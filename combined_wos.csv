  ##2G - Thursday 6 June - Melbourne report  

**2G STRENGTH SWITCH**

Hi teamüçä!

Resuming normal service. Few gremlins posting yesterday... so thanks u/matthotlips for posting and u/lookie4dacookie for getting me back online ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I also posted the 3G in a separate thread via another member ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**Treads 1**

Courtesy u/c01788

Treads 1 - I did this about 8 hours ago now but I think I've remembered correctly!

30 second base at 7%

1min normal base

30sec base 7%

30sec base 5%

1min normal base

30sec base 7%

30sec base 5%

30sec base 3%

1min normal base

30sec base 7%

30sec base 5%

30sec base 3%

30sec all out 1%

I believe PW %s were 8, 6 and 4, then 10 or higher for the all out

[Disregard my notes from earlier, which I‚Äôm keep in for posterity... Round 1 was a series of hills going up and down the hill - 7, 5 and 3% mixed with base and push and varying interval lengths, the longest being 90 seconds. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt remember it in detail, you‚Äôll understand why I‚Äôve forgotten when you read round 2... Only so much a person can remember! I can update if anyone can help me out! üß°]

Move to floor. 

**Floor 1**

* 10 upright row, weighted
* 10 Leg raises
* 5 each side low row single arm on bench
* 10 ? raise on the floor but I forget exactly what sorry! 

Repeat twice and then complete one 250m row 

**Treads 2**

This is a run/floor combo. Grab a set of weights for bicep curls. 

160m below is 0.1 miles. This is the jogger and runner combination. 

* 160m 7% push
* 10 bicep curls
* 160m 7% base
* 160m 5% push
* 10 bicep curls
* 160m 7% base
* 160m 5% base
* 160m 3% push 
* 160m flat road base
* 10 bicep curls
* 160m 7% base
* 160m 5% base
* 160m 3% push 

I may have misremembered but I‚Äôve done my best!

**Floor 2**

45 seconds on 15 seconds off, repeat 3 times:

* band around wrists, low rows
* band as above, scissor legs
* mid band around calves, toe reaches 
* band as above, in &amp;amp; outs

  ##Tuesday 30 November 2021 - Orange Everest 3G 60 minutes  
Hopefully you are nice and rested for today‚Äôs benchmark - its a good one! As the name suggests you are doing a lot of hill running today and then dying for the rest of it.

The treads is just one long slog up a hill, first half is an increasing incline and the second half is still at incline but decreasing in intensity. Then you finish it with an all out. I have never done the 3G before so any distance today would be a PR. Happy with my effort but would have been stoked if I had made it past the 3km mark (was just shy of it). My strategy hasn‚Äôt really changed over the years - start with a push or close to it and hold that for as long as possible and then decrease the further incline goes up. At the top of the hill try to hold base if you can and then as the declines come off increase your speed. Trick is to increase speed as fast as you took it off for the first half of the climb. Good luck!

The row is a struggle coming off the run but it isn‚Äôt particularly hard. Distance challenges with reverse lunges with a medicine ball. The last minute of the row is an all out in time with the treads.

On the floor it is all chest, back and arms with some core. It‚Äôs not particularly hard and most people finished well within the 14 minutes. 

The run is the focus today and it is a brute of a challenge. I think it is the third hardest after the 14 minute row for distance and dri-tri. I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Sunday 28 November 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
Nice, pure ESP template today with equal measures of endurance, strength and power. There are three 6.5 minute blocks, each with a specific focus. For the timing purists out there we did have a 90 second transition between blocks.

On the treads the power block is all push to all outs with a walking recovery in between. On the strength block it is push at inclines with base as recovery followed by a 30 second all out. On the last endurance block it is long pushes with a base followed by a 30 second all out. My suggestion is to up the push and base for the power block and try to hold your normal push for the strength block. See if you can also increase the all outs for the power block. 

For the floor there are deadlifts, low rows and some power moves. Each block starts with a short row and then the rest of the block is the repeats of the exercises. I think for the strength block you can go a little bit heavier but on the endurance block drop the weights a little as your forearms and triceps will be burning by the end of the block. With the lateral hop, this is not the same as the speed skater as the hops are a bit shorter and you should hold it for a couple of seconds at the end of each hop.

Not as gentle as yesterday but I quite liked it for the variety. I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Friday 26 November 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Really liked the template this morning but don‚Äôt be fooled by the designation, it felt more like an endurance template with all the pushes, all outs and minimal walking recovery. For those of you who are over the chest and arm exercises, today is all about legs and core!

On the tread the first block alternates between short pushes, bases and an all out. The second block is a run for distance and the third block has a longish push to all out and a final all out to cap it off. My suggestion is to try and up your push and base for the first block as even though it is a 6 minute run, it won‚Äôt feel that bad as you have that small recovery for the base efforts. I also tried to beat half my distance from the first block with the 3 minute run for distance. The reason I said that it feels like an endurance template as I still managed to get out over 2 miles on the tread which is my normal benchmark for an endurance template.

On the rower you have three blocks as well. The first has reverse lunges as the restercise and the second jump squats. Lots of all out rowing today so plenty of splats.

On the floor we have deadlifts, speed skater lunges and hip hinge swings. Plenty for the legs. One long block where the core exercises halve each round. Last block is all timed with the treads and the rower.

I quite liked today but it is pretty challenging. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Mrs DC is doing the 2G so we should see that soon.

  ##Thursday 25 November 2021 - Endurance ‚ÄúRestercise‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
After yesterday‚Äôs cluster set (I was thinking of a more unflattering term), today‚Äôs template is a return to good old endurance work. Plenty of scope to play with your speeds and I think you will get splats all over the different stations.

On the tread block there are two sets, the first plays with incline pushes and the second block is pretty straight forward with three pushes and an all out. I didn‚Äôt think this was too bad and I played around in the second set to keep increasing the push speed. For those who think doesn‚Äôt look like an endurance workout, I still managed over 3.2km (2 miles) in the tread block which is consistent with an endurance day.

The first row set has distance challenges and the second set is timed with the treads with power squats as the restercise. I found on the second set the heart rate stays pretty high as the restercise is designed to get the blood pumping. 

The floor has some good moves including more low rows (I can foresee some comments here), step ups and neutral full thrusters!

All in all I liked today‚Äôs template more than yesterdays and found it challenging but very doable. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Tuesday 23 November 2021 - Power ‚Äú500m Row Benchmark‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
Happy benchmark day! Today‚Äôs focus is the 500m row so don‚Äôt be too disappointed if it is a low splat day or you don‚Äôt have too much left in the tank for any of the treadmill work. No PB for me today but did get a respectable row, something to build towards for the next one. 

The format of the template is that everyone rotates through the 4 minute blocks so you are relatively fresh for the row. So if you start on the rower you will do your row, then the floor block and then the tread and then start the 7 minute blocks on the rower again.

The tread, as you expect, is pretty easy. First round is 160m (0.1 mile) runs with 30 sec walking recoveries. If you are yet to do the row I would suggest just doing a base pace to keep your legs warm. The second round has longer pushes but they are not challenging at all. If you are missing some splats after the first round I suggest jogging the walking recoveries and doing a more aggressive push. Try doing a one minute all out for the last effort.

The floor is not too bad either, all upper body and core. The hardest one is probably the bench step down hammer curls but even that can be taken a bit easier by using lighter weights.

As the main focus of the day is on the benchmark and the rest is really just filler I found it pretty gentle and gave it a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5. If you are not that fussed about the benchmark then it could be an easy day to skip given the workout is pretty tame for the main.

The treadmill has two blocks, where you are trying to beat the distance from the first block. The first block is all distance challenges and the second is all timed. I think most people got the distance challenge given you have another 30 seconds compared to the second block. I think the highest incline on the first block that anyone got to would have been about 4% so it isn‚Äôt too bad.

The row is also relatively tame compared to the weekend. The first block is using the exercises to increase your heart rate and the second is all about the all out rows. 

The floor brings back concentration curls and single arm chest press and low rows. I didn‚Äôt mind any of the exercises here and found the hardest to be the seated shoulder press to stand.

All in all, it was challenging but pretty doable. 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) did the 2G this morning whilst I did the 3G. Nice little run/row with inclines today. I didn‚Äôt think it looked that hard (compared to the weekend‚Äôs efforts) and I would give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Mrs DC agrees with me.

  ##Sunday 21 November 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) did the 3G which features a lot more rowing obviously. She said it wasn‚Äôt as hard as yesterday and thought it should be a 3 on her scale but has conceded that it should probably be a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

She‚Äôs a bit hazy on the tread block as she had to leave early, but it adds up to the 14.5 minutes that the rest of the blocks had. The butt kicks on the row block is jogging on the spot and kicking your heels back so that they touch your butt. I had a little snigger when she told me the name of the exercise.

If I had to pick one of out the 2G or 3G I would probably pick the 2G as I like the longer distances on the treadmill.

  ##Saturday 20 November 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
I totally regret all the beer, champagne and hot chips I ate last night. Today‚Äôs class is a cracker - very challenging and you should be getting splats all around the studio today. For those who complained about not having enough legs in the week then today is your day. If you can move your legs after this class then I would be most surprised.

First off the tread. Four blocks all following the same pattern. It is pretty much a 2 minute push to a 1 minute all out, 1 minute walk and then another 1 minute all out. The second minute of the push is a base and incline (so it still feels like a push). In between blocks is a solitary 1 minute walk. I really like the tread block but I would only get into the green for maybe the last 5-10 seconds of the walking recoveries. This tread block is pretty tough and sneaky as it feels like it should be a power block but you end up doing endurance like distances (I managed just under 5km / over 3 miles outside of the warmup) for the entire treadmill block.

The floor has the same exercises on repeat but it is broken up with 1 minute all outs on the rower in time with the second all out the tread. The floor exercises are pretty much all legs and backs with lateral lunges, deadlifts and rows. 

I found today‚Äôs template pretty tough and I‚Äôm going to give it an alcohol induced 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 18 November 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Nice little template today as a recovery from yesterday‚Äôs benchmark. Hope everyone did well yesterday and hit some goals in the run.

For the tread block today you have only three small hills all at base pace. You have a 30 second all out but it only comes after a long base. I didn‚Äôt feel that the tread block was that challenging today and I just jogged during all the walking recoveries. No sex all outs today - very sorry, it is a PG version of OTF on offer üòÜ (For those who don‚Äôt get this you need to read the early intel thread from yesterday)

The rower on the other hand had me in the orange zone for pretty much the entire block. Something about the lunges (not jumping this time thankfully) that kept the heart rate up. Not too many people got to the row for distance. I blame the time it takes to do all the lunges with exercises. On the restercise with the overhead tricep extension, the coach told us to keep the medicine ball overhead whilst doing the lunge which makes it all the bit harder.

The floor features the bosu again for the first time since Hell Week I think. We have shoulder presses, pullovers, bicycles and a new one which is the single arm press to a toe reach. This is kind of like a single leg v up on the bosu but you have a weight in one arm and the other is out to the side for stability.

All in all I enjoyed the template. I got plenty of splats but it didn‚Äôt feel overly challenging. I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Wednesday 17 November 2021 - Endurance - 12 minute run for distance - 3G 60 minutes  
Everyone who has been here for a while knows this template. It‚Äôs the 12 minute run! Plenty of threads on how to prep for this and strategies for the day. My personal strategy is to do set and forget and depending on how you feel you creep it up to an all out for the last 30-60 seconds.

I wasn‚Äôt confident on doing a PB coming out of lockdown so my goal is to maintain a minimum of 16 kmh (10 mph) for the entire 12 minutes. One of the coaches set a new studio record by holding 20 kmh (12.5 mph) for the entire run - nuts!

The rower is an endurance row with jump lunges as the restercises between efforts. My suggestion is to not go too hard on this if you still have the run to go. If you have done your run then whatever you can push through is effort enough.

On the floor it is all pretty light as you would expect. Ab dolly work, seated torso rotations and some light TRX work. This is just filler time for the run.

Apart from the run, this is pretty a pretty cruisy template. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

**Tread Block**
* Reset your monitor
* 12 minute run for distance
* Record your distance

**Row Block - 13.5 minutes**
* 400m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* 350m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* 300m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* 250m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* 200m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* 150m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* 100m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* Row for distance

**Floor Block - 13.5 minutes**
* 8 each x balance bicep curl
* 20 total x seated torso rotation
* 12 x ab dolly knee tuck
* 12 x ab dolly pike
* 12 each x TRX single arm low row
* 12 x TRX tricep extension",1637128842

  ##Wednesday 17 November 2021 - Endurance - 12 minute run for distance - 2G 60 minutes  
Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) did the 2G. She didn‚Äôt think it was the hardest outside of the run and gave it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

In terms of the order, if you do the first tread block you will be doing this:
* Tread Block 1
* Floor Block 1
* Tread/Row Block 2
* Floor Block 2

This way you get the run out of the way early and keep your legs relatively fresh.

**Tread Block 1**
* Reset your monitor
* 12 min run for distance
* Record your distance

**Tread/Row Block 2 - 7 minutes**
* 400m row + 12 x alternating jump lunges
* 300m row + 12 x alternating jump lunges
* 200m row + 12 x alternating jump lunges
* 100m row + 12 x alternating jump lunges
* Row for distance

**Floor Block 1 - 14 minutes**
* 8 each x balance bicep curl
* 16 x ab dolly knee tuck
* 20 x seated torso rotation
* 12 each x TRX single arm low row
* 400m row (once only)

**Floor Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* 12 x TRX tricep extension
* 12 x upper cuts
* 12 x ab dolly pike",1637128836

  ##FRIDAY 12 DEC | 6 Legs A Shakin'  
GOOD MORNING WORLD.

Intel from Chch, NZ.

I never go to 6am class but today I did; you're welcome.

Can't remember the proper names for all the floor exercises, but you'll get the gist.

&amp;#x200B;

***2G***

&amp;#x200B;

**FLOOR**

**Block 1**

6x, all on left side

\-single leg sit to bench (*The VVA screen demo Demo Diane was doing these with the opposite leg's heel on the ground which made it much more doable than the one with the leg hanging in the air!*)

\-stand on bench single leg lateral toe touch things

\-single leg power step ups on bench

repeat on right. repeat both sides.

&amp;#x200B;

\-6x weighted bench sit-ups

-12x toe reaches

repeat from the beginning until block is done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Block 2**

6x, all on left side

\-s/a shoulder press with reverse lunge

\-s/a upright row lateral lunge

repeat on right.

\-150m row

Repeat until block is over.

&amp;#x200B;

**TREADMILL**

Yeah it's a toughy but goody. I started on the rowers and would recommend that!!

&amp;#x200B;

Runners: At an aggressive push, starting at 1% incline, 1 min ""all-out"", 90 second WR at 1%. repeat all the way until 10%. Try to maintain that aggressive push throughout!

PW/Bikes: I'm really sorry I can't remember this. I was preoccupied trying to convince myself I could do anything for 1 min!

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, wonder why you put yourself through xmas hell week for a pair of socks...

Enjoy!",1575612064

  ##Thursday - Endurance (500 Reps)  
* Ok there is ALOT to this workout And can seem confusing at times. Especially if you were me and went at 5am in the morning üò¥üò¥

** Thank god there is NO inclines today üôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. My legs are crying üò≠ after yesterday‚Äôs hills üèî 

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It is a partner workout

üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è all the class is on the floor for some of the workout ü§î 


45 minute block

Partner 1 

320 metre run

Floor 

15 medball squat jump to front press

15 medball iso squat front press

20 medball abdominal rotations

X 5

Partner 2

300 metre row

Floor

15 bicep curls

15 front squat with weight

10 overhead presses

10 sumo squat then squat jump

X5


Ok so the treadmill does their 5 x of their runs to floor and the rower does their 5 x rower to floor and whoever finishes FIRST swaps with the other. In our class the treadmill swapped with the rower when they were up to their 3rd or 4th round. 

If you finish you get rid of the floor reps and just run and 320 metres and swap with your rower friend. 

So sorry if that doesn‚Äôt make any sense! I did my best

Have a fab day everyone  ü•∞",1575525661

Nice ESP template today. I did pay the penalty of a big night the night before and the long pushes to all outs were a bit of a stretch today. Plenty of mini band work on the floor and the row blocks are not too hard but don't go too quick unless you want a long squat hold at the end.

  ##Saturday 21 November 2020 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Nice endurance template today with a couple of running / rowing challenges. If you want to beat your distance in the second tread block I suggest just either upping your base or the second push pace and that should do the trick. The floor features no mini bands, ab dollies, burpees or palm to elbows so I quite enjoyed it!

**Tread Block 1**

* 2.5 min push
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 1 min AO
* Hit pause and record your distance

**Tread Block 2**

* 2.5 min push
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 1 min AO
* Try to beat your previous distance

**Row Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 2.5 min distance row
* 90 sec recovery with 16 squat jacks
* 2.5 min distance row
* Record your distance

**Row Block 2 - 6.5 minutes**

* Row half your distance from block 1 + 8 squat jacks
* Keep rowing half your distance + 8 squat jacks until you get to the 100m round then keep repeating

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**

* 16 x goblet sumo squat
* 8 each side x lateral step down to toe tap
* 12 x alternating step up
* 12 x plank pull through
* 16 x static crunch alternating heel touch",1605938422

Btw the push at the begin of each tread block is coached then straight into the run row (except for block one which has a base). The goal for block 2 was to beat our row distance from block one since we had an extra minute.

  ##Friday 20 November 2020 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Nice little run block in this one, long pushes to all outs. I kind wanted the run block to be a bit longer on the sprint inclines but still was ok. Rowing was quite good as well with a mini challenge between the firsts and second blocks. Floor had some good power moves (and no burpees, mini bands or ab dolly!).

  ##Thursday 19 November 2020 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice template today. You will need to up your push pace to get some splats on the treadmill and if you go to green on the walking recovery I suggest getting back to base sooner. The row is not too bad - our coach modified ours a little so it may be a bit different elsewhere. On the floor we also modified this to go to fatigue rather than the 8 reps. We also replaced the plank jack with a squat jump and the uppercut with a shoulder press.

  ##Wednesday 18 November 2020 - Strength (Endurance) 2G 60 minutes  
Billed as a strength day but the 2G is definitely more endurance in nature with some nasty pushes on inclines that get longer block by block. The floor is quite good with some nice exercises that you can test your max weight on. We didn‚Äôt do the bird dog on the low row so that is another good one to test your weights on.

  ##Monday 16 November 2020 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
This is a pretty sneaky template. The treadmill blocks are harder than they appear because of the very short recovery efforts in between the pushes and all outs. Floor blocks are not too bad with a little plank hold in between efforts. The all out on incline just try to hit an ‚Äúall out feeling‚Äù.. I certainly didn‚Äôt want to hold a normal all out at 7% incline.

Power workout for your Sunday - only one 1 minute all out, no ab dolly and no inclines!

  ##Saturday 14 November 2020 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
This seemed pretty easy after yesterday‚Äôs Friday the 13th special. Nice little run block (think it will be a run row for 2G) coupled with a longish row. Floor was ok but not a fan of the ab dolly (hate pikes!).

For the tread block I treated all of the distances above 300m as an aggressive push and then anything under that as an all out. If your heart rate drops too fast on the walking recovery then just do the next round (on the longer runs I would wait maybe 20-30 seconds, on the bonus round maybe 10-15 seconds), its all about when you can feel you can do the next distance goal.

**Tread Block - 14 minutes**
* 480m (0.3 miles) + 45 sec WR
* 400m (0.25 miles) @ 2% + 45 sec WR
* 320m (0.2 miles) @ 3% + 45 sec WR
* 240m (0.15 miles) @ 4% + 45 sec WR
* Bonus rounds: 160m (0.1 miles) @ 5% + 45 sec WR, repeat dropping 1% on incline each round

**Row Block - 14 minutes**
* 10 x medicine ball reverse lunge to tricep extension
* 100m row
* 10 x medicine ball iso squat to overhead press
* 100m row
* Repeat, adding 100m to the rows each round
* When you finish the 400m row round then just repeat the medicine ball exercises

**Floor Block 1 - 6.25 minutes**
* 10 each x split stance high row
* 10 each x half kneel single arm to lateral step up
* 10 each x single arm shoulder press

**Floor Block 2 - 4.25 minutes**
* 30 sec of ab dolly push up to oblique knee tuck
* 15 sec recovery
* 30 sec of ab dolly pike
* 15 sec recovery
* 30 sec of ab dolly rollout
* 15 sec recovery
* Repeat",1605333677

  ##Tuesday 16 November 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
I enjoyed this template a lot more than the power session yesterday. A lot more splats on offer, particularly on the rower where you will be racking up some serious metres. It is fun but also understand if you would want to take a rest day ahead of the 12 minute benchmark tomorrow.

The treadmill only has two blocks. Each feature a mini endurance style teaser into some serious inclines for the all outs. The all outs are only 30 seconds and the entire block only has six of them. Try to hold your all out pace on the inclines as you will have plenty of walking recovery to get your breath back.

The rower is one long long block with jumping jacks, pulsing squats and alternating jump lunges as the restercise. Only a few people made it to the row for distance so it is a challenging one. If you get to the end you will be rowing a minimum of 2500 metres. A lot more if you get to the row for distance. 

On the floor you have an endurance style block first with heaps of reps that drops as the block goes on. For the person who was wishing for pop jacks, I hope you are happy as they have now made a worse combo - the plank jack to pop jack! Most of the moves on the floor are combination ones (squats with low rows etc) so don‚Äôt try to rush them as you may do yourself some mischief. On the first block, suggestion is to go light on the high rep count round and you can increase it as the reps drop.

Even though I enjoyed this template I still found it pretty challenging. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Monday 15 November 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
I‚Äôll be honest, was still a bit sore from the weekend so the feather rating probably reflects a little about how I took it a little easier today.

The treadmill is a bit of a relief today but it does feature one minute all outs but it does have plenty of walking recoveries. OTF is continuing the theme of pushes to all outs today but they didn‚Äôt feel too bad after all the endurance type work through the weekend. The walking recoveries between blocks today were about a minute so feel free to get back to base when you edge down into the green.

The row block has a distance challenge for you between the two main blocks. All the rows are all out rows. The first main block uses 1 minute and 30 second all out rows and the second main block uses distances. 

On the floor you are working each side of your body in turn and it is all pretty much lower body and core. For those of you who missed all the squats last week and said that we don‚Äôt do enough lower body, fill your boots on all the squat and lunge action today. If you have missed froggers of late, they are back again today!

Today I didn‚Äôt find it that hard, but to be honest it was kind of like my version of a green day. I gave it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Sunday 14 November 2021 - Strength ‚ÄúDrop Sets‚Äù 2G 60 minutes  
Hope you aren‚Äôt too sore after yesterday‚Äôs chipper as today has some nice challenging blocks for you on the tread.

The 2G has 3 blocks all with a similar format. A push to a base, base and incline and then straight back into a push. The blocks all finish with a 30 second push at 6% straight into a 30 second all out. A good day to try out a new base pace to see how you go on the inclines. The base with inclines are all a choose your own adventure with different incline challenges for you to try out. Still a good distance day, I still got over 3 miles (got just shy of 5km) on the tread so it felt almost like a mini endurance session at the same time.

On the floor there are only two short rows compared to the 3G (Mrs DC /u/mrsdc031114 is doing that one) as the real focus is on the drop sets. Shoulder presses, triceps and low rows are the order of the day. I think the last drop set was during hell week and that was all back and chest focused. As with all drop sets, pick a weight for the first four reps as heavy as you can manage and then immediately switch to the lighter weight for the 12 remaining reps. I reckon if you can‚Äôt get 12 out on the second round then that‚Äôs fine as I think you should be doing them to exhaustion.

It was a bit of a struggle today given the chipper yesterday but it wasn‚Äôt as hard. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Saturday 13 November 2021 - Endurance ‚ÄúThe Chipper‚Äù 2G 60 minutes  
Today‚Äôs class is a real treat. I love the chipper. Such a good endurance challenge on all of the stations. One of my all time favourite templates. I am pretty sure this is a hell week template that they decided to put into the signature workout rotation.

The tread is pretty simple. Start with a 3 minute push and then you chip away at it. 30 seconds off every push effort until you get to 90 seconds and then it is 15 seconds off each effort. Finishes with three 30 second pushes and a 30 second all out. Extra points if you can turn the final push to all out into a one minute all out! I think if you are looking to really push it today try increasing your push speeds a little with each effort. You will get some pretty impressive distances today, I ended up with over 5.6 km (3.5 miles) excluding the warmup, so it is a good time to do a little bit more training before the 12 minute run on Wednesday.

The floor is also pretty crazy, huge numbers of reps combined with neverending rows. I was in the orange zone pretty much the entire floor block as well. The only real rest you get is the walk back from the rower to the floor. If you are pushing it then try jogging it back. If you need to catch your breath then take it nice and slow.

This template is definitely is a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness but it is super fun. I haven‚Äôt had this many splats since hell week.

  ##Friday 12 November 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Another nice little template, inclines are back and we have a tasty little rowing distance challenge. The 2G is a run/row with some nice opportunities to pick up metres on the tread block.

On the tread block we have inclines at base and push and only two all outs, only 30 seconds a pop. I am worried that OTF has temporarily forgotten about the 1 minute all outs and they will come back with a vengeance next week. I found the tread work pretty easy so feel free to up your base pace and to jog through the block breaks. 

The rower is a bit of a killer with ground to press featuring as the chosen restercise today. Don‚Äôt know what is worse, squat jumps or ground to press. Both get my heart rate going. You essentially have 30 second all out rows followed by increasing reps of the ground to press. Furthest in our class this morning was around 2400m if you want to compare. To get that you will really need to push through the reps quickly and maximize the time on the rower.

I liked the floor as well. We have two variations on the chest press, some back exercises and TRX work. Nothing too outrageous.

If you are interested, I saw the 2G run/row card. It is in two blocks. Block 1 is 10.5 minutes and you are doing 160m (0.1 mile) run, 30 sec all out row on repeat, adding 2% to the incline each round. Keep a track of the distance you get on the rower as you will need to try beat on block 2 which is 10.5 minutes again starting with a 160m (0.1 mile) run @ 7%, 30 second all out row on repeat but decreasing the incline by 2% each round.

I thought today was pretty good. I would give it a 4 out of 5 but am aware that inclines are not for everyone! Today‚Äôs template is a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out 5 for gentleness.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min base @ 7%
* 1 min base
* 1 min base @ 5%
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 3%

**Row Block - 14 minutes**
* Reset row monitor

* 2 x ground to press
* Repeat until time, each round adding 2 reps to the ground to press up to 20 and then go back down again
* Accumulate distance, anything over 1800m is pretty good

**Floor Block 1 - 6 minutes**

  ##Wednesday 10 November 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Another great template today, really enjoyed this one! Only 30 second all outs, nice little distance challenges on the rower and the floor block has some great power moves for everyone to enjoy.

On the tread, you start with a warm up block where the longest effort is only 90 seconds (compared to yesterday‚Äôs 4 minute monster). The blocks are pretty short and only feature 30 second all outs. Not huge distances on the tread today so it is a good one to try out a new all out pace. If you are maxing out the speed its time to try out the inclines. Probably the hardest bit is the push to all out but they are pretty short.

On the rower you have a few distance challenges and they have mixed up the restercise with a squat to calf raise. After all the rowing recently my glutes a bit sore so probably not the best exercise for them but it is nice to do something other than ground to press.

On the floor we have some old favourites - sumo goblet squat, low bench squat jack, reverse lunge with hops. If you are like me and not great on all the jumping I just took the hops out.

Pretty good template today, I didn‚Äôt think it was too hard (compared to yesterday). I give it a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Mrs DC is doing the 2G so will find out what that looks like when she gets back.

  ##Wednesday 10 November 2021 - Power / Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) did the 2G this morning and the coach called it a power and strength class. Given this one had inclines I am inclined to believe that description. She‚Äôs a bit fuzzy on the tread blocks but she remembered having to hold base at incline up until the walking recoveries and the all outs. 

This is a bit different to the 3G and not sure if the coach modified our one to take out the inclines. Still doesn‚Äôt look too bad even if it is base and inclines. 

She didn‚Äôt think it was too hard and gave it a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Tuesday 9 November 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Two great templates in a row! Nice pure endurance template today. Lots of running and rowing on offer today in the 3G.

On the tread it is pretty simple. Two long pushes and equal bases followed by a four minute run for distance. I took it as a bit of a 12 minute prep and held push for the 2 push efforts and then just above push for the 4 minute run for distance. Nice block to get distances and I got well over 2 miles on the tread effort.

On the rower, it is distance challenges again with restercises (sumo deadlifts and ground to press). Relatively easy to get to the bonus round this time but you will be in orange pretty much the entire block.

The floor block has a lot of core and balance work with the TRX. The last 4 minute block is coach‚Äôs choice and our coach made us do a heap of crunches, side planks and shoulder taps.

Today is challenging but doable. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. 

**Tread Block**
* 3 min push
* 3 min base
* 2 min push 
* 2 min base
* 4 min run for distance

  ##Monday 8 November 2021 - Strength ‚ÄúEverest Prep‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
Much happier with today‚Äôs workout compared to yesterday! As you can imagine, Everest prep is all about the hills today and trying to keep your base pace for as long as possible.

Two tread blocks today. The first is increasing inclines and the second is on the way back down (still at inclines, but they decrease) with a short all out at the end. The coach told us to keep base pace for as long as possible but if you want a bit of a challenge try to keep your push for as long as possible and decrease it as the inclines get steeper. 

The row is pretty challenging today. Nine 200m rows with restercise in between. A few got to the bonus round. I managed three bonus rounds which saw me at orange for the entire row block.

The floor block has a lot of balance work. Again, if you don‚Äôt like the bench bird dog, just do a single arm low row. I replaced the palm to elbows with push ups.

Pretty tough workout today, I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) is doing the 2G so will see what that looks like a bit later.

  ##Sunday 7 November 2021 - Power 2G 60 minutes  
Not a fan of the template today - wasn‚Äôt a great power template with only 9 minutes on the treadmill.

All the treadmill blocks followed the same format, push - base - push - base - push - all out. I suggest going a bit more aggressive than normal as you will not have a lot of time to get your splats and you are not going to get any on the floor.

In between the tread blocks you have rowing which follow exactly the same format. Pretty boring.

The floor has ab dolly work and some weighted exercises. Not a fan of ab dolly pikes so I swapped them for knee tucks.

All in all, template is not hugely challenging unless you go a bit harder on the treadmill and rower. I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Would have been a 4 but the tread work is relatively challenging for the short amount of time that you are up there.

Edit: /u/mrsdc031114 did the same class after me and can confirm that there are only four blocks in each section (4 on the tread/row and 4 on the floor). There is heaps of transition time so if you are trying to do the math then factor in about 90 seconds per transition, plus 5 minutes of warmup, 4 minutes of cool down and 2 minutes to swap the room. She also did not think the template was that great today but could also be because we went to dinner last night and enjoyed pasta, champagne and wine!

  ##Saturday 6 November 2021 - Strength ‚Äú5x5‚Äù 2G 60 minutes  
I don‚Äôt know if it was the beer and wine last night but I found today‚Äôs strength session quite hard. The whole concept is that you are doing clusters of 5 exercises (5 rounds on the tread, 5 rounds on the floor) and is designed for you to go heavy on the weights.

The treadmill consists of five rounds where the pushes change in duration and incline. I found this pretty tough after yesterday, especially the longer pushes into the all outs. Whilst the inclines don‚Äôt seem that bad I think that this feels more like an endurance / strength session (I finished up doing over 3 miles on the tread excluding warmup) so it will test the legs. You do get good walking recovery between blocks but I found it was only enough to barely get into green before you head off again.

I quite liked the floor block. The exercises are pretty standard and not too fussy. Good opportunity to go heavy. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to rush through this block if are going heavy. I needed to rest between weight exercises. You only have three rows of 300m so you can go nice and quick for these ones to keep the heart rate up.

I found this template tough but doable. Didn‚Äôt feel like a hell week throw back so for that I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Wednesday 26 May 2021 - Mayhem 4 ‚ÄúThe Wicked 90‚Äôs‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
The title of the template is the clue, everything is in 90 second blocks. Plenty of burpees today plus inclines. I would say that this is probably the second toughest template after Sunday‚Äôs epic all outs so be prepared.

The tread block is all pushes to all outs culminating in a run for distance. All of the pushes and the runs for distances are at incline. You have a little bonus all out at the end that you can take at an incline (if you are so inclined.. ).

The rower follows the same pattern and thankfully there is no restercise. On the row for distances most people averaged between 350-450m+.

The floor though is a bit of a monster after yesterday. One minute of burpees, clean to front squats, half thrusters! All timed! My arms were dead after yesterday so I really struggled with the motions using arms above my head!

All in all, pretty tough.. 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Maybe it was the upper body workout yesterday but I thought this was tougher than Tuesday. Coach said that the next two days are run/rows on the the 2G and run/rest for the 3Gs.

  ##Tuesday 25 May 2021 - Mayhem 3 - ‚ÄúUpper body uproar‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
Good news is that this tread block is nowhere as bad as it was on Sunday. Bad news is that there is a 6.5 minute run for distance. At incline. There is also a good chance that you will not be able to feel your chest, back, biceps and triceps after this workout.

The tread block I didn‚Äôt find too hard but I don‚Äôt mind all outs at incline. The first block is all outs at increasing incline and the second block you run your total distance at decreasing inclines. I didn‚Äôt find this too bad and I could run just above my base pace for the whole block and beat my distance pretty easily. If you are interested, I did 1.350km in the first block (0.84 miles) and 1.650 in the second (1.03 miles) pretty comfortably in the second. 

Row block follows the tread block but the second second block you row your distance and have some squat / lunge exercises before getting back on the rower. Not many people finished the exercises to get to the row for distance.

Main star is the floor work. This is where you will absolutely fatigue your upper body. I am thinking that if you can still feel your upper body the day after this template then maybe you needed to up your weights. I wouldn‚Äôt go too heavy though, I was fatiguing quickly at probably 75% of my normal weight range.

Today I would have given this a 2 if it was just the row and tread blocks but the floor block makes it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5.

Set the rower to 1600m
When treads are walking, you are doing 15 pop squats then back rowing ASAP
If completed 1600m, do 150m rows alternating with 5/10/15 pop squats

PS - the 60min is a 2000m row with 20 pop squats I believe

  ##Monday 24 May 2021 - Mayhem 2 ‚ÄúClock won‚Äôt stop‚Äù 2G/3G 60 minutes  
Ok, personally I didn‚Äôt find it as hard as yesterday but it is all up to how you approach the run and the row blocks. Every session today is being run as a 3G so you will not escape the row block!

For the treads it is all run for distances with short walking recoveries. If you want to really push yourself then treat these as max efforts but be warned that the recovery times are not nearly enough to get your heart rate back down. I did these at around push pace and found it tough but doable. The kicker is that you get a couple of all outs at the end to prepare you for the row block (if you are doing the tread first or second).

The row block is also tough. First you have 2000m to get through but the trick is that when the treads are doing walking recoveries you are doing **20 squat jacks**. Once you finish the 2000m you have the rest of the block to get out 4 x 150m rows with more squat jacks. Oh and you have a squat hold at the end. To do this one, try and pump out the 2000m as quick as you can so you don‚Äôt need to do all the squat jacks and then time the 4 other rows so you don‚Äôt have to squat hold for minutes. 

The floor block features a lot of ultimate burpees and core work. You will be pretty fatigued by then so try to break up the core work into sets of 10s or 25s.

Pretty tough today but I didn‚Äôt think it was as bad as yesterday. Still a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness though.. not easy at all.

  ##Sunday 23 May 2021 - Mayhem 1 - ‚ÄúThe rest is yet to come‚Äù - 2G 60 minutes  
First mayhem done and it is pretty hard. The plus for doing a 2G today is that there is no rowing and no inclines. But that is about it.

On the treads it is 12 one minute all outs with a 90 second run for distance at the end. The walking recoveries in between start at 30 seconds and then work their way up to 1 minute. You should need every second of those walking recoveries. Try to keep your all out pace throughout but it is pretty challenging.

On the floor it features only three types of exercises (yay more lunges.. ) and you have four rounds of 1 minute non stop action with restercises in between. I found the floor pretty challenging today, they have certainly picked some of the more hated exercises to feature here. My suggestion is to slow down on the reps as you will think you can just punch them out but then there is yet more in the next couple of rounds. Floor block feels a little short (by 90 seconds) so wonder if we were supposed to do another set of exercises in here - wasn‚Äôt complaining about getting some rest though.

All in all a pretty decent intro to mayhem. I found this pretty hard today and could see my average heart rate for the session was up by 8-10 bpm over my norm. I give this workout a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. I will see if Mrs DC has a 3G when she goes later today but the 2G was pretty nasty. Apparently tomorrow‚Äôs workout will feature a lot more rowing.. can‚Äôt wait!

  ##Sunday 23 May 2021 - Mayhem 1 ‚ÄúThe rest is yet to come‚Äù - 3G 60 minutes  
And here is the 3G version thanks to Mrs DC. Think I prefer my 2G over this one.. the row looks brutal! With the row, it looks like you only get the rest that the treads do in the walking recovery - ie 30 sec rest in between blocks 1 and 2, 45 seconds between 2 and 3 and 1 minute between 3 and 4.

Rating stays the same.. 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Tuesday 18 May 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Quite enjoyed the template today coming off a rest day yesterday (weekend templates were brutal!). Just straight power on the treadmill and rower and some nice power/strength combos on the floor. No weird restercise / combo weights / balancing exercises just good old fashioned exercises.

On the treadmill it is only push and all outs. Good news is the pushes get shorter each round and the all outs only stay at 30 seconds each time. If you can, try and increase your push pace each round and do the last round as one minute all outs. Felt like a nice way to get warmed up into the 12 minute run on thursday.

The row features stroke counts and all out rows with a bit of recovery rows in between. I was able to keep my heart rate in the orange on the rower for the strength rows and the all outs so you should be able to get some splats on the rower today as well.

I quite liked the floor. You have some pretty classic strength moves here and I don‚Äôt mind the power push ups / pull ups. They use the term ‚Äúload and explode‚Äù - I think that this refers to loading up the weight for the strength move and then exploding for the power move.

For today‚Äôs template I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. If they had some restercise on the rowers it may have moved it up to a 4 but felt like it was a decent workout today. I also chose to up the push pace and all outs so maybe I made it a little harder than it should have been.

There's a better explanation in the 3G post about the workout, but here's the specific 2G format!

  ##Sunday 16 May 2021 - Endurance (the Chipper) 2G 60 minutes  
Today is one of those ‚Äúspecial‚Äù workouts. Not sure if it is a signature but it sure feels like it! 

On the treadmill it is a 22.5 minute straight workout starting with a 3 minute push and working its way down. Pretty straight forward and I like how the pushes decrease but the bases stay the same so I didn‚Äôt have the same sense of impending doom with normal endurance blocks. If you can, try to either increase your base or push towards the end as the durations shorten.

The floor is a monster. I did see the chest flys and curls and thought I may not be able to handle it after yesterday but it to be honest it all blends into each other. You will definitely get splats on the floor. Your reward for finishing the floor / exercises is to do it all again (minus the row!). I finished with maybe 5 minutes to go so I was not particularly enthused about that prospect.

Pretty tough class today, lots of splats on offer. I rate today‚Äôs template a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

//PSA for the week: if you ever get scratched or bitten by a bat go to the ER immediately as they carry rabies (or the lyssavirus if you're in Australia - it's a virus related to the rabies one). Please note I said scratched as well - the virus is shed in the saliva and they groom like cats so a scratch can get the virus into your nervous system. OK, PSA over. //",1574488821

  ##Wednesday Nov 11 2G.  
Apparently a Power Day but felt 100% like endurance. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Run-Row

- 320m at Push 
- 10 Lower Half Squats
- 200m Row
- 10 Squat Jacks

Add 2 to both Squat sections each rotation. 

Aim is to get somewhere between 4-6 rounds, though I hit 7 and felt ok so I think it‚Äôs a low benchmark. 


Floor

Each exercise goes for 30s, followed by 10s rest, and then 1min rest at the end of the round. 

- Squat to over head press (L)
- Double crunch
- Squat to over head press (R)
- Sprinter sit-ups 
- Plank with toe taps
- Bench hop overs
- Can‚Äôt think of the term - end of bench seated hold with raised feet + rotation with weight if you like 

4 rounds in total. 

Really fun workout for those who like endurance. üéâ",1605074483

  ##Tuesday 10 November 2020 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
I took a sneak peek at the 2G to mentally brace myself but this is a very tough workout if you did yesterday‚Äôs endurance special. The row block is pretty brutal so there is plenty of splats on offer. For the competitive types the furthest row round in today‚Äôs class was the 600m round. Nice day to go heavier on the weights for the second floor block.

  ##Wednesday 4 November 2020 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
Nice sneaky ESP session today. You will get some serious distance on the treadmill even if one of the blocks is strength and the other is power. The last rowing block got me with the bicep curls to shoulder presses and my arms were quite gassed by the end.

  ##Friday 30 October 2020 - Close Encounters of a Burpee Kind 2G 60 minutes  
No second guessing what the focus exercise is today. You have all kinds of burpees on the floor paired with some body weight exercises. For the 2G we had a nasty little run row with a run for distance at the end. It did feel like that we needed another round as a few of us did quite a long run at the end. If you are the competitive sort then the furthest in our class was the \~1800m (1.12 miles). Still inclines but doesn't feel as bad as the ones during the week.

For those interested in the 3G, someone may post later today, but it looked like the 2G block just without any of the rows.

If you complete all the floor blocks you will have done 100 burpees - not bad!

  ##Monday 26 October 2020 - Walking Dead Legs 2G 60 minutes  
Nice run row today if you are doing a 2G.. mostly it is sprint rowing with loads of squats and then a short incline run (10%!).  Rows increase whilst the run remains the same. If you get down to the end then you can do the run for distance.

The floor work is all with the mini bands. I think the last floor block is a coaches choice as we didn't have a screen for it but we continued with the mini band work.

I didn't think today was too bad but still managed a lot of splats on the run/row and my glutes were painful after the mini band work.

I think it's clear that the OTF template makers have no friends and no social lives, otherwise they would know that Friday nights are for drinking and partying and therefore Saturday morning workouts should be gentle and nice. Not this. My only consolation is that it's too late for most of you in America and you'll suffer as much as I just did.

  ##Classic Friday 13th 2G Workout  
It's that time again, after what seems lIke ages we finally have Friday 13th.  True to OTF style this one is a killer and it's definitely a unique version of a power day.  If you're starting on the treadmills, well you're not actually.  You get sent to the rowers for a nice whallop of all outs, then it is three intervals of run for distance.  Tread time is short so make the most of it.  The floor I found was brutal, all those short bursts of weighted and bodyweight cardio add up.  All told I would give this 2 out of 5 for easyness.


Rower Blocks 1 and 3:   3.5 min 

- 5 x 30 sec all out row
- 15s recovery in between

Tread Block:  13 min

- 3 x 3.5 min run for distance
- 75s recovery in between

Floor Block 1:  3.5 min

- 30s neutral half thrusters, 15s rest
- 30s ice skaters, 15s rest
- 30s neutral half thrusters, 15s rest
- 30s ice skaters, 15s rest
- 30s neutral half thrusters

Floor Block 2:  13 min  (all exercises 13 reps)

- TRX power pullups
- TRX rollouts
- Repeat two rounds 
- Bench power pushups
- Bench tap squat jumps
- Repeat two rounds
- Power situps
- Bear plank hops
- Repeat two rounds

Meanwhile the coach will call for two rounds of 13 burpees that you do in 75s while the treadmills are on walking recovery

Floor Block 3:  3.5 min

- 30s ground to press, 15s rest
- 30s high knees, 15s rest
- 30s ground to press, 15s rest
- 30s high knees, 15s rest
- 30s ground to press",1628830838

  ##Friday 5 November 2021 - Endurance (12 minute run prep) 3G 60 minutes  
No hell week castoffs today, we have a relatively normal template other than the 2 x 5.5 minute run for distances!

For the run we had the option of doing the 12 minute run straight instead of breaking it up. Up to you really. It is a good gauge for how you will go in the actual benchmark. I normally just look at the distance at the end of the first block and multiply that by around 2.2 to get your projected distance. Not too bad today given how sore I was after yesterday but got blitzed by one of the coaches who was taking the class who ran the two blocks at the max treadmill speed (20 kmh or 12.5 mph). Generally my strategy on the practice runs is to do a set and forget for the first block and then on the second start where you left off and creep up the speed as you go.

The row block is tough but doable. Distance challenges with a restercise. Essentially set your distance goal with a 90 second row at the start and then you are chipping away at it for the rest of the block.

The floor block features the mini bands again. Haven‚Äôt seen these since before lock down so it was like seeing an old friend and then realising why they annoyed you so much. I don‚Äôt expect to feel my glutes again for the rest of the day and I now also have little bald patches on the legs where they rub off the hair. I modified the weights section as I hate all the balance work and just did heavy bench single arm low rows, chest press and normal bicep curls.

A lot more doable than yesterday‚Äôs hell session. I give today‚Äôs workout a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. There is plenty of transition between stations (the blocks are only 12.5 minutes) so you may find your heart rate dipping a bit today (unlike yesterday).

**Tread Block**
* Reset monitor
* 5.5 min run for distance
* 90 sec WR
* 5.5 min run for distance

**Row Block - 12.5 minutes**
* Reset row monitor
* 90 sec row for distance
* Record your distance
* Repeat until time:
* Row distance again, taking off 50m each round
* 10 x medicine ball halos
* If you get to 0 then row for distance

**Floor Block - 12.5 minutes**
* 3 rounds of:
* 8 x mid band static crunch in and out
* 8 x mid band hip bridge
* 12 x mid band seated knee tuck
* Repeat until time:
* 8 each x bench bird dog single arm low row
* 8 each x single arm chest press
* 8 each x balance bicep curl
* 16 total x plank pull through",1636088438

  ##Thursday 4 November 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
I think the OTF gods forgot that tomorrow is the 12 minute prep and not today. Kind of felt like a 12 minute and Everest prep in the same class. Pretty tough workout today, especially with the incline distance challenges and the power moves on the floor.

The tread is broken into a endurance, strength and power block. The 3 minute distance challenge is a real lung burner but then the legs get a workout in the next block with serious inclines. The last block should be a power challenge but when did we start calling the 90 second run for distance and all out? You are to record your first distance in the first block and use that throughout. I don‚Äôt think anyone got 1 km (0.625 miles) but I got reasonably close. The second block you are to try and match and beat your distance but will be super challenging given the inclines (starts at 12%!!).

The rower is also pretty hard. You have a 3 minute distance challenge in the first block and then a 5 minute block to beat it with restercizes. The last block is timed with the treads. My rule of thumb is that generally if you are doing a push or an all out you should get similar distances on the rower. I managed just over a 1 km which is about what I got on the treads.

The floor was pretty tough after the treadmill and rower and I was pretty spent. You have loads of power moves including burpees, plank jacks and ground to press. If you are pushing hard you should get splats on the floor as well. Wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of all the jumping moves on the floor.

Today was pretty tough, similar in intensity to yesterdays power workout. I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Edit: downgraded the gentleness on reflection of the workout.

  ##Wednesday 3 November 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Felt very refreshed after a day off yesterday! Just as well as today‚Äôs template features a killer row block. 

For those who were missing the 30 second all outs they are back in all their glory today. We have one minute pushes, base pace and very short all outs. Great tread block, didn‚Äôt feel too hard and gives you plenty of time to ease off if your heart rate is spiking. I tried to increase the all outs as I did each round (speed or inclines), give that a go if your heart rate is dropping too much in the walking recovery. I try to use the walking recovery to only just get back to green for a couple of seconds before heading off into the next effort.

The bad news is the row block. This is pretty tough and only five people in our class made it to the row for distance. Three rounds of 4 distance challenges with a restercise. You will need to push pretty hard to finish this one - I don‚Äôt think I got out of the orange for this entire block. Mrs DC also did the 3G and said no one in her class finished the row block.

The floor block has one of my favourite exercises - the dead lift! Opportunity to go heavy in the first set and then you have some more core exercises in the last block (v-up hold!).

I thought today was tough but doable. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Tuesday 2 November 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Nice little strength session courtesy of Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114). I felt like sleeping in this morning so didn‚Äôt do the class and will just take a rest day. 

The tread features three blocks. The first two feature inclines and the last is on the flat road. All the inclines are at base pace with some flat road base pace to break it up. Only three all outs at flat road. The pushes to all outs look pretty tough. Looks doable compared to yesterday. 

The floor is all upper body and a bit of core. Gorilla rows make a come back!

Mrs DC gave it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

My studio is still just doing 45 minute sessions but figured I would post this early given only the 2g intel is up.

  ##Monday 1 November 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Someone should remind OTF corporate that hell week is over and we deserve a break! Today‚Äôs template is a killer on the treadmill and the rower.

The tread block has 2 three minute pushes and a 2 minute run for distance! Not much rest today. Pretty simple block but a killer on the legs. To be honest you got more rest yesterday. You will get some serious mileage on the treadmill today.

The rower is also a leg burner. Not only are there long rows but you have some awkward leg burning restercises as well.

The floor is the only place where you will get any real rest. I didn‚Äôt mind the exercises but with the high reps don‚Äôt go too heavy. I quite like Arnold presses and prefer hammer curls to bicep curls.

Today is pretty hard, I think the only thing stopping this being a hell week template is maybe more power moves on the floor to jack up your heart rate. I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Sunday 31 October 2021 - Hell Week #8 ‚ÄúUltimate Ultimatum‚Äù 2/3G 60 minutes  
This was a nice little treat this morning. The ultimatum is to pick either a trick workout or a treat. All templates are run as a 3G today.

For the treadmills this involves either picking 1 minute all outs with 45 second walking recoveries (the trick) or 1 minute pushes with 45 second base recoveries (the treat). You get eight of these culminating in a 30 second all out. After yesterday‚Äôs all outs I decided to go for the treat and have a nice long endurance block.

For the rower there is no trick or treat. You have eight 1 minute all outs with 45 seconds to recover with 30 second lateral hops.

On the floor you get to pick either a weighted exercise or a core one. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of most of the core exercises so ended up doing weights for the whole block.

Nice one if you felt like you missed out on something during the week. I also felt this was pretty easy compared to all the other workouts. I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness and a 1 (‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 for hell week intensity. I kind of wanted a super crazy template to finish but the OTF template gods must have had mercy on us. Easiest of the whole week even if you did all the ‚Äútrick‚Äù exercises.

  ##Friday 29 October 2021 - Hell Week #6 ‚ÄúMeltdown‚Äù 2G 60 minutes  
Disclaimer: I really enjoyed this workout even though it is extremely difficult. On the plus side there are no inclines and the floor work is pretty simple (though designed to give you lots of splats). For those of you whom liked the 14 minute row for distance the other day, there is plenty here for you to like! If you don‚Äôt like to row then I suggest you do not go to a 2G today as you will spend half the class on the rower.

The tread block is a run/floor block. This is a first for me after all so many years of going to OTF. I quite liked it but you don‚Äôt have very long on the treadmills. Basically you are doing an all out at flat road on the treadmill and then heading over to the floor to do variations of snatches (am expecting a few comments on this today) as the power move coupled with stability exercises. The furthest distance you will have to run is 400m (0.25 miles). My suggestion is to treat all of the run blocks as an all out and don‚Äôt go too heavy on the weights (unless you are brave) - it is too easy to do yourself an injury on the snatches and the step ups and you will be fatigued from the run (I was in the orange zone the entire block). If you are missing the inclines from the previous hell week templates feel free to add some incline to your all outs.

On the rower it is a 4.5 minute row for distance and the variations of all out and recovery rows in 3 blocks afterwards. Each time you are trying to beat your previous best distance (our coach took mercy and said to get within 100m of your best but I think it is really to beat your previous distance).

All in all, this is a tough template. Simple but designed to keep your heart rate in the orange / red zone the entire time (this gave me the second highest splats out of hell week). I give this a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness and 4 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ) out of 5 for hell week. Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) is doing the 3G so will see how that compares, my feeling is that it will be a lot more manageable.

Big shout out to my studio for cracking the global top 10 in the 14 minute row for distance. Huge averages given how many people we had do the class that day.

Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) did the 3G and they obviously didn‚Äôt get the memo about no inclines. She didn‚Äôt think it was that bad so I would say it is a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 still for gentleness and a 3 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 for hell week. I reckon this looks a lot easier than the 2G.

  ##Sunday 21 February 2021 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
I feel sorry for my poor wife who did a double ESP session yesterday and was hoping for something a little easier today. It's not great news as we have an endurance session today to backup the one from yesterday. Good news is that the pushes get shorter through the duration of the tread blocks, you have a whole 90 seconds to walk in between blocks and the bases are reasonable.

The floor has a lot of reps on the incline bench, mainly working your chest and back. There is a small row block in here but it is just a bunch of all out rows with plenty of rest-ercise in between. Probably not the day to go too heavy as the number of reps is pretty high. I went maybe 5kg lighter than my normal weight range on the chest press.

I thought it was pretty gentle compared to yesterday but can understand if the body needs a break from the long runs. Maybe they should have switched around the template descriptions between today and yesterday?

I thought this class was gentle. Only 30 second all outs. Loads of walking recovery. I think only the balance bicep curls were the ones I didn‚Äôt like on the floor. I felt like the OTF template designers were being kind to us after the benchmark. Good day to go for a PB on your all outs.

  ##Sunday 14 February 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Today is a strength class but to be honest it felt like a continuation of the endurance workout yesterday (my wife did a double class yesterday so she is already dreading this one) with longish runs and rows. The dreaded sit to stand comes back (I haven't seen one of these in ages) and the long floor block all has lots of single arm / leg combos (I get it.. singles for Valentine's day).

If you want to get to the bonus round in the run then my suggestion is not to go too hard in the upfront tread and row block. I treated them like all outs and only just finished the row in the run/row block.

**Tread Block 1**

* 3 min run for distance
* 90 sec to transition to rower

**Row Block 1**

* 3 min row for distance

**Run/Row Block - 14 minutes**

* Run your distance from tread block 1
* Row your distance from row block 1
* 16 x reverse lunge
* Run half your distance from previous run block @ 3%
* Row half your distance from previous row block
* 8 x reverse lunge
* Run half your distance from previous run block @ 5%
* Row half your distance from previous row block
* 4 x reverse lunge
* Run for distance @ 1%

**Floor Block 1 - 7.5 minutes**

* 6 each x single arm neutral half thruster
* 6 each x single leg v up
* 8 each x single leg sit to stand

**Floor Block 2 - 14 minutes**

* 2 rounds of:
* 6 each x bench single arm fly
* 6 each x single arm split stance high row
* 6 each x single arm chest press
* 2 rounds of:
* 6 each x TRX bicep curl
* 6 each x TRX low row
* 6 each x half kneel to lateral step up",1613282438

  ##Thursday 11 February 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes - ""Make a Friend""  
Now I know why the previous days have been so gentle. This template is pretty tough, particularly on the row. The tread portion of this template only has three all outs so it did feel more like an endurance session rather than power. On the rower you are basically paired up with the person next to you alternating short row efforts. I don't think I have had that many splats on the rower before. It could be who you get paired up with but we were going pretty hard the entire block. The legs were pretty dead by the time I got to the floor and then you are faced with low bench burpees to squat jacks and full thrusters.

Good fun but is a pretty challenging class.

  ##Wednesday 10 February 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Another gentle template - two days in a row! I feel like the OTF template designers have a heart after all.. maybe because it is Valentine's day soon. Today does feel more like a strength/power day especially with the row block.

Treadmill block has a few nasty inclines but they always have a similar length base pace at flat road to follow. If you want an extra challenge keep the inclines for the all outs (max all out is 45 seconds).

The floor has a little bit of strength work but not that much to be honest. Most of it is core work. Don't expect to be challenged here unless you up your weights for the step up and bicycle press.

Tomorrow is a signature workout called ""Make a friend"". The coach said that this will be a partner workout.

  ##Tuesday 9 February 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Very gentle template today. All outs are only 30 seconds long. Only a couple of 90 second pushes. Floor has the bosu but the exercises are not outrageous (shoulder press and chest flys). Row is long but not intolerable. Good day for if you are feeling a little flat and want to ease into the rest of the day.

For those interested, the furthest row in our group was around 1650m.

  ##Sunday 31 January 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
Can't believe it is February already tomorrow! Pretty tough template with quite a few all outs. The strength portion of the block is quite rough with steep inclines and then a sneaky one minute all out at the end. All tread blocks have a 90 second walking recovery and there is always a 1 minute transition to the rower on the floor.

I would start the tread block with a aggressive push (1-2 kmh higher than your normal push) but you will be back to your normal push pace for the last block. I was dying on the last tread block knowing there was a 1 minute all out given all the steep inclines - there wasn't really any rest in that one.

I hate side plank leg lift so I just did situps with rotations, you could also do static crunch heel taps. I also dislike the balance bicep curls.. just do normal ones if you are like me (but 12 reps rather than 6 each side).

  ##Saturday 30 January 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice power template today. I got splats on all three stations so it is a good all round workout. The only exercise I wasn't a fan of was the minute of burpees that break up the two blocks on the floor. We were coached to do the ground to presses in a single move. Combine this with the pop squats and you should have a pretty heart rate on the floor.

Plenty of walking recovery between the all outs so you get a bit of time to catch your breath. You also get a minute between the transitions on the floor to the burpees and on the rower to the all out rows.

  ##Sunday 24 January 2021 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
Nice endurance template today. High splats on the treadmill and you will get some on the floor as well as you move into the row blocks. All of the all outs are 1 minute today and they all follow a short push effort to get your lungs burning. For tread block 2 and 3, we were asked to reset and compare your distances.  Furthest in class was around the 2.2km (1.375 miles). It will be quite hard to beat your distances if you just do your normal push or base in the last block, you will probably need to up both to beat the distance. Our coach also put out a challenge to do the 30 sec push to 1 min all out as a 90 sec all out (no thanks!).

We were also asked to compare the 3 min row distance to the 90 second one and try to beat half your distance from the first round. The 3 min row was pretty rough after the long tread blocks so you should be able to beat it.

  ##Thursday 13 May 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
First off, happy birthday Mrs DC! Wishing her a great day. Secondly enjoy those hills as there is more of them today after yesterday‚Äôs benchmark row.

The tread block only has 2 hill efforts per block, but you can add hills to the all out at the end. The push to all out at the end (on incline) is a nice way to cap it off and you should be gasping for breath at the end. I know the second tread block doesn‚Äôt quite add up. I think to keep it to 6 minutes it might be a 75 sec push at the start and a 45 sec push after the incline base but the coach had it at 30 seconds off for each ( 1 minute and 30 seconds respectively).

The row has a warm up effort followed by an all out. There are two exercises to do in between rowing which should keep your heart rate up.

The floor is all upper body drop sets followed by a core exercise. Today is a good day to go heavy on the hammer curls and the shoulder presses.

For todays template I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

Guessing a little as to duration of pushes and base - I think the pushes both decreased by 30 seconds in each block, but otherwise the same structure; so blocks 2 and 3 reduce to 6.5min and 5.5 min. Inclines may also move around slightly - but nothing higher than 6%

  ##Wednesday 12 May 2021 - 2000m row benchmark 3G 60 minutes  
Happy benchmark day! Toughest of the row benchmarks, the 2000m row!  Definitely recommend starting on the row if you are aiming for a good time.

For me, the focus is on the row and the rest of the template is a bit of a blur of trying to recover your arms and legs post row. The floor has some light leg exercises but most of it is core work.

On the treadmill it is 480m repeats with increasing sets of inclines. If you are interested then the highest incline anyone got to in the class was 6%.

For the row, my recommendation is to settle into a pace for the first 1000m that gets into the orange zone and then look to build from there. I aim to not do a high tempo and keep my stroke rate around 30 strokes per minute. For the last 500m I up the stroke rate and try to maintain the wattage and for the last 250m this is an all out (or as close to an all out as I can manage). Fastest in our class today was 5:54. I got a PB but nowhere near that pace!

For this template I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 mainly because of the row and the nasty tread block.

Some of you have asked if you can support a charity of my choosing. One of my friends is doing the Tour de Cure walk for cancer. If you would like to support this then you can pledge at https://tourdecure.grassrootz.com/can4cancer-sydney-2021-walk/danielle-malone - any amount would be gratefully accepted.

Nice little power template today. Only wrinkle here is the love affair with the burpees on the floor but the rest of it is ok.

On the tread, you do have a couple of one minute all outs at the start but the rest is all 30 second efforts. The rower has some distance and restercises with the medicine ball.

The floor has three variants of burpees with some bench work but all in all it isn‚Äôt bad.

For today‚Äôs template I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness mainly because of all the burpees.

  ##Sunday 9 May 2021 - (e)SP 2G 60 minutes  
Happy Mother‚Äôs Day for the mums in Australia (especially Mrs DC). For your Mother‚Äôs Day you get a strength and power workout. Good news - the inclines only go up to 6% and there is heaps of walking recovery in here. 

On the treads there is four blocks. Blocks 2 and 4 are the power blocks. Blocks 1 and 3 have a short push pace to start and then you just alternate between base at flat road and base at an incline. Max incline in block 3 is the 6%. I didn‚Äôt find it as hard as yesterday and there is a lot of walking between the blocks.

The floor has very little rowing for a change. The floor features a strength move first followed by some power / core work. Today is a good day to go heavy on the dead lift and the sumo goblet squats.

All in all I felt this was pretty gentle. I give today‚Äôs template a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Saturday 8 May 2021 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
What are the template designers at Orange HQ thinking? Endurance after the Orange Everest??? They are mad. 

23 minutes straight on the treadmill with a nasty 4 minute push. I was on struggle street with the treadmill today and had to drop my base pace to recover a bit. For the tread (especially if you have done Everest) my suggestion is if you are struggling then pick either push or base to drop a little bit and try to hold that. I chose to keep my push pace and drop the base.

I have to say, where was this template last month!? I managed to get 5.761 km (3.6 miles) which would have been handy during marathon month. 

The floor isn‚Äôt too bad, heaps of lower body work with TRX. A few rows but pretty manageable. They have a few weird moves like the iso single leg dead lift with low row but they aren‚Äôt too bad. 

For today‚Äôs template I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. I think this is the punishment for those who late cancelled yesterday to skip Everest and extra punishment for those who dared think they could back it up the next day.

  ##Thursday 6 May 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice little power session as an teaser to the orange Everest tomorrow. The treadmill isn‚Äôt too bad but the floor has a nasty little timed section that will get your chest and core burning.

The treadmill has three blocks. None of the all outs are longer than 30 seconds and the longest push is only 45 seconds. It‚Äôs a good day to up your push and base pace if you want to get some decent splats on the treadmill. I tried a push of 18kmh (11.25 mph) and a base of 15 kmh (9.4 mph) for fun and got a decent mileage (3.4 km or 2.13 miles) for the block.

On the rower it is all timed with the treadmill but the second block features high knees and squat jumps. 

On the floor it is all pretty ordinary except for the second block where it features pikes on the ab dolly and pushups with rotations. We were told to sub out the pushups for a high plank if it got too hard.

Wasn‚Äôt too bad today but some parts were reasonably challenging (second floor and row blocks I am looking at you!). I give this a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##3G - Wednesday 12 February 2020  
#POWER

* I did this class hours ago and can see that no one has posted the intel, so here's as best as I can remember it...
* I don‚Äôt know the 2G

**Treads**

Two blocks. 

Block 1 is along the lines of:

* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min AO
* WR
* 30 sec AO
* WR
* I may have missed a push interval here 

Block 2 is along the lines of:

* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 45 second push
* base recovery, maybe 90s
* 1 min AO
* WR
* 30 sec AO
* WR
* 30 sec AO
* WR

The tread blocks seem short but I managed to run 3km‚Äôs excluding the warmup so I felt it was a decent block of work. 

**Rowers**

Also two blocks, timed with the treads. 

Block 1 is:

* 150m row
* 12 reverse lunges
* 150m row
* 10 reverse lunges
* continue as above, only reducing the lunges by 2 

Block 2 is a continous row, matching the tread block ie if they're all out, you're all out etc etc...

**Floor**

14 mins:

* mini band, three steps left and right (sorry I forget the name)
* mini band, plank position moving legs left and right (sorry I forget the name)

You do the mini band exercises three times and follow them with this:

* weighted reverse lunge on the low bench
* reverse lunge with a hop up on the low bench
* low bench in and out plank

Enjoy! üê®",1581487261

  ##Saturday 3G ESP  
Hey Everyone 

Welcome to the weekend

So today‚Äôs class sounds tricky and I‚Äôll try my best to explain it

If you start on the treadmill - you stay put for 14 minute go nowhere! 

If you start on the rower or the floor it‚Äôs like your own mini tornado

Rower = Rowing block 4 mins then floor 4 mins then rowing 4 mins

SWITCH to floor

Floor = Floor 4 mins then rowing 4 mins then floor 4 mins 

SWITCH to treadmill 

In the floor and rowing blocks remember where you left off and pick up in the next block

I hope that makes sense for everyone üòÖ

Floor 

Hip hinge low row 8

Plank kick through 12,10,8
 
Power pull up 8 

Hip hinge tricep kickback 12,10,8

Hip hinge reverse fly 8

Alt plank punch 12,10,8

Treadmill

üü†2 minute push

üü¢ 30 second base

üü†30 second push

üü¢ 30 second base

üî¥ 30 second all out

üîµ 60 second walking recovery 

üü† 90 second push

üü¢ 30 second base

üü† 45 second push

üü¢ 45 second base

üî¥ 30 second all out

üîµ 60 second walking recovery

üü†60 second push

üü¢ 30 second base

üü† 60 second push

üü¢ 60 second base 

üü† 60 second push

üî¥ 30 second all out

Rowing Bock 4 mins

200 metre row

Medball overhead reverse lunge 12,10,8,6,4,2 - if you finish go back up the reps

Woah! That was exhausting writing everything! Enjoy your weekend everyone I‚Äôm out!",1581141664

  ##Sunday 17/11 Take a hike  
Intel from Sydney...This was a 2G class.

Partner workout for the first and last blocks only

**Block 1 (Partner)**

One partner is on the tread, the other on the floor/rower. The tread incline starts at 4% and then increases 1% every minute for the rest of the block. The row increases by 100m each time you row (so each partner rows 100m, 200m, 300m etc)

Partner 1 starters on the tread @ 4% incline at push pace

Partner 2 starts on the rower: 100m then moves to floor for core exercise:

* 10 x straight leg left
* 10 x shoulder raise to touch your toes
* 10 x bicycle sit ups

Once Partner 2 is finished you then swap, and carry on till the block finishes (think it's c 7.5m)

**Block 2 (Not a partner block. You start as per original card and then swap half way through).**

**Tread** (not sure these are exactly right, but it definitely starts at 2min and decreases in length to a 30 sec all out). All at 1% incline.

* 2 min push
* 2 min base
* 90 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 30 sec all out

**Floor**

* 10 x lateral toe tap step down
* 10 x lateral toe tap step down with power

(You do 10 on the left then 10 on the right)

&amp;#x200B;

* 10 x sumo squat with jump
* 10 x power pull up with jump (TRX)

**Block 3 (Partner)**

The tread incline starts at 15% and then decreases 1% every minute for the rest of the block. The row decreases by 100m each time you row starting at 300m this time.

Partner 1 starters on the tread @ 15% incline üò¢

Partner 2 starts on the rower: 300m then moves to floor for core exercise ‚Äì all in plank position

* 10 x plank spiderman leg raise
* 10 x plank with arm punch

  ##Monday 11th of November - 3G - Sydney - Endurance  
First of all, WE GOT ""BABY SHARK"" IN OUR PLAYLIST! And ""Can't stop the feeling"" from Trolls and Lizzo's ""Truth hurts"" so I'm not entirely sure who put this playlist together because it was hilarious. 

Now then: start on the treads today if you can, because you have 13 straight minutes of push pace running with inclines thrown in. The rowers and floor switch like a thousand times while the treads keep going. 

TREADS

* 3 min push / run for distance
* 1 min at 7 incline (maintain push speed if possible)
* 3 min push / run for distance
* 1 min at 4 incline  (maintain push speed if possible)
* 3 min push / run for distance
* 1 min at 9 incline  (maintain push speed if possible)
* 90 sec run for distance or AO if you can

ROWERS

* 3 min row for distance

\*\*\* switch to floor \*\*\*

FLOOR

* TRX low row x 15
* Squat x 15
* Plank jack x 15
* Power sit up x 15
* Straight leg raises until time is called

\*\*\* switch to rowers \*\*\*

ROWERS

* 3 min row for distance

\*\*\* switch to floor \*\*\*

FLOOR

* TRX low row x 10
* Squat x 10
* Plank jack x 10
* Power sit up x 10
* Straight leg raises until time is called

\*\*\* switch to rowers \*\*\*

ROWERS

* 3 min row for distance

\*\*\* switch to floor \*\*\*

FLOOR

* TRX low row x 20
* Squat x 20
* Plank jack x 20
* Power sit up x 20
* Straight leg raises until time is called

Finish on whatever normally comes after what you started on. I started on treads so I finished with another floor block (15 of each). Treads and rowers finished with a 3 min run / row for distance.

  ##Monday 19 October 2020 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
Nice little endurance run row for today.. maybe in preparation for tomorrow's Hell Week template? The floor block is a bit repetitive so you may want to pace it a little otherwise (like me) you will be doing a 2.5 minute body weight plank at the end.

On the tread blocks I think they should have put in longer rows as it gives you a bit too much time for the run. You are trying to beat your distance from the previous block but I think it gave too much time in the later blocks.

**Tread Block 1 - 3 minutes**

* 100m row
* Run for distance for the remainder of the block, record your distance

**Tread Block 2 - 4 minutes**

* 200m row
* Run for distance for the remainder of the block, try to beat your previous distance

**Tread Block 3 - 5 minutes**

* 300m row
* Run for distance for the remainder of the block, try to beat your previous distance

**Tread Block 4 - 6 minutes**

* 400m row
* Run for distance for the remainder of the block, try to beat your previous distance

**Floor Block 1 - 3 minutes**

* 14 x hand release push ups
* 14 x dead lift
* 14 x hip bridge
* Repeat power sit ups until time

**Floor Block 2 - 4 minutes**

* 12 x hand release push ups
* 12 x dead lift
* 12 x hip hinge low row
* 12 x hip bridge
* 12 x power sit ups
* Repeat straight leg lift to hip raise until time

**Floor Block 3 - 5 minutes**

* 10 x hand release push ups
* 10 x dead lift
* 10 x hip hinge low row
* 10 x alternating lateral lunge
* 10 x hip bridge
* 10 x power sit ups
* 10 x straight leg lift to hip raise
* Repeat kneeling plank bird dog until time

**Floor Block 4 - 6 minutes**

* 8 x hand release push ups
* 8 x dead lift
* 8 x hip hinge low row
* 8 x ground to press
* 8 x alternating lateral lunge
* 8 x hip bridge

  ##Sunday 18 October 2020 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
More of a strength and power focused template today. Was quite surprised that it was an almost ordinary template again, very doable, all outs were only 30 seconds. I keep thinking the OTF template designers are lulling us into a false sense of security before unleashing hell week on us.

Five tread blocks with a 90 second walking recovery between each. Blocks 2 and 4 are a progressive push with inclines but a nasty little incline all out at the end. Floor is all power moves paired with strength exercises. A few short rows but nothing out of the ordinary.

**Tread Block 1**

* 30 sec push
* 30 sec base
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 2**

* 1 min base @ 3%
* 1 min base @ 4%
* 1 min base @ 5%
* 1 min base @ 6%
* 30 sec AO @ 7%

**Tread Block 3**

* 30 sec push
* 30 sec base
* 30 sec AO
* 30 sec WR
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 4**

* 1 min base @ 6%
* 1 min base @ 5%
* 1 min base @ 4%
* 1 min base @ 3%
* 30 sec AO @ 7%

**Tread Block 5**

* 30 sec push
* 30 sec base
* 30 sec AO
* 30 sec WR

  ##Saturday 17 October 2020 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice power block today - very doable with only one block of one minute all outs. The row block is good if you want to try and maximise your splat points as you are just racing yourself.

The floor has some complex moves. The squat to curl to full thruster looks like suitcase squat, then a bicep curl and then squat back down to do a full thruster. No hamstring exercises today which is great news.

* At the end of the 250m round, reset monitor and row for distance

**Row Block 2 - 4.5 minutes**

* 250m AO row + 12 x medicine ball squat to press

  ##Thursday 15 October 2020 - Hell Week Throw Back #3 2G 60 minutes  
Someone needs to have words with OTF head office. To do this straight after Orange Everest is downright rude! Long endurance block on the treadmill and it is all lower body work on the floor. I asked the coach about the 3G version and there is also a long (14 minute) block on the rower as well with a similar concept (increasing run for distance with short walking recoveries) on the treadblock. 

I would start on the treadmill first as if you go heavier on the floor your legs will be wrecked by the time you get to the treadmill. I don't normally get that many splats but today was close to 20 just on the treadmill! We were coached to go at a pace between push and all out. I did just above my normal push (a little below my 12 min run benchmark pace) and at the last WR I only just managed to get back to green before doing the last run.

I took my time on the floor and just did heavier weights. You also have the option to do a row every round. Most of us did that. All exercises had weights including the jump lunge (small weight on chest to balance).

**Tread Block - 23 minutes**

* 30 sec push
* 1 min AO
* 45 sec WR
* 90 sec run for distance
* 45 sec WR
* 2 min run for distance
* 45 sec WR
* 2.5 min run for distance
* 45 sec WR
* 3 min run for distance
* 45 sec WR
* 3.5 min run for distance
* 45 sec WR
* 4 min run for distance

**Floor Block - 23 minutes**

* 500m row (once only - we had the option to repeat each round)
* 6 (L) bench static lunge
* 6 (L) bench static jump lunge
* Do all on the left and then swap and do the right leg
* 12 x dead lift
* 12 x sumo squat
* 6 each side x step up
* 12 x front squat",1602738083

  ##Wednesday 14 October 2020 - Orange Everest 2G 60 minutes  
This is one of my favourite signature workouts and I love the 2G version of this. 3G feels a bit short so I always try to do the full 23 minute treadmill version. The tread block is the classic climb to the top, as fast as you can do it and then it flattens out (goes down the other side of the hill) until you are back running at your push / AO pace. I haven't done it in a year and beat my PB by 10m which was my goal!

Floor block is not too bad with a few all out rows and an opportunity to go heavy on the single arm rows, bench presses and hammer curls.

Coach also mentioned that tomorrow is another hell week throw back / sneak peek.

  ##Sunday 11 October 2020 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
I was kind of hoping that today would be a nice and easy power session after yesterday's epic endurance themed hell week throw back. But no.. it's another endurance template! Tread block is broken up into two sections - the first is all long pushes with short bases, the second is progressive pushes and longer bases. Both finish with a 90 second run for distance (i.e. all out).

  ##Saturday 10 October 2020 - Hell Week Throw Back #2 (Endurance) 3G 60 minutes  
Bad news it is another hell week template. Good news is that it is nowhere as bad as the first throw back template. Long runs with very little rest and a nasty little row block.

Furthest in our class was 3.7km (2.31 miles) in the run and 2.9km (1.81 miles) in the row. If you want a good row distance I would suggest starting on the rower as your legs will be screwed after the treadmill block. I started on treadmill and by the time I got to the floor I was pretty much spent.

**Tread Block - 14 minutes**

* 4 min run for distance
* 45 sec base
* 4 min run for distance
* 45 sec base
* 3 min run for distance
* 30 sec AO

**Row Block - 14 minutes**

* 4 minutes of 30 sec AO rows + 8 froggers
* 45 sec AO row
* 4 minutes of 30 sec AO rows + 8 froggers
* 45 sec AO row
* 3 minutes of 30 sec AO rows + 8 froggers
* 30 sec sec AO row

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**

* Exercise 1 - 50 x bench hop overs
* Exercise 2 - 40 x skiier swings
* Exercise 3 - 30 x pop jacks
* Exercise 4 - 20 x power pull ups
* Core Exercises - 10 x straight leg to raise, 10 x power sit up with rotation
* Round 1: exercise 1 + core
* Round 2: exercise 2 + core
* Round 3: exercise 3 + core
* Round 4: exercise 4 + core
* If finished then repeat exercises at half reps",1602306088

  ##3G Hell week Saturday  
(With 2G intel ü§´)


Hey Everyone

So today is the second hell week session and it is a spicy one. You practically get zero rest! I did a 3G and did the treadmill block twice and missed the rowing so I am really unsure to what went on in the rowing block. Sorry! 

Sneaky 2G intel.....

I had a look at the template and it looked a little like this. Our coach said be thankful we did the 3G as the 2G looked let‚Äôs just say hellish üòà 

Treadmill

4 minute run for distance 

2 minute base

4 minute run for distance

90 second base

4 minute run for distance 

60 second base

4 minute run for distance 

30 second base 

3 minute push

All out

Floor Block

Quite similar to the 3G floor exercises

With 

1000 metre row

800 metre row

600 metre rows

(To be honest this is just a rough idea. They gave me a look for 30 seconds)

3G

Treadmill 13 mins

4 minute run for distance 

45 second base

4 minute run for distance 

45 second base

3 minute push

30 second all out 

Rowing block

4 mins 

30 second row
8 Froggers

45 second all out

4 mins 

30 second row
8 Froggers

45 second all out

4 mins 

30 second row
8 Froggers

45 second all out

Pretty sure this is the template 

Floor Block 13 mins

1. 50 bench hop overs

2. 40 skier swings

3. 30 pop jacks

4. 20 power trx jumps

10 leg extension hip raise

10 Power sit up with rotation

Ok so you always do the leg extensions x 10 and power sit ups x 10 then you add in exercise one 

Second time through do the 2 core exercises then exercise 2. 

Once you have completed all 4 rounds you do exercises 1-4 at half the reps

Have a fab day everyone!

  ##Thursday 8 October 2020 - Hell Week Throw Back #1 (ESP) 2G 60 minutes  
This is a true hell week workout and our coach today said he has seen the templates for what is coming and he is saying that this will be the toughest hell week yet. I am inclined to believe him after today. Everything is on inclines except for one short all out, even the walking recoveries are done at an incline. Lots of burpees so expect to get a load of splat points on the floor.

For the all outs at an incline you obviously don‚Äôt do at your normal all out speeds (unless you normally do at a crazy incline) but has to be above your base. Coach also said that for the bases you should try and hold your normal base pace throughout.

Nice one after the benchmark yesterday.

  ##Thursday 8th October 3G 60min Intel  
Posting for all those curious about the 3G!

Can confirm it was horrible and our coach also said hell week is 100x worse üôÉüôÉ

If you can, I would recommend starting on the tready - can't imagine doing those blocks without fresh legs!

&amp;#x200B;

**TREADY**

Block 1 - 4 mins

* 45 sec base at 11%
* 45 sec base at 10%
* 45 sec base at 9%

* 30 sec AO at 6%
* WR at 6%

Block 2 - 2.5 mins

* 30 sec AO at 5%
* 30 sec WR at 5%
* 30 sec AO at 3%
* 30 sec WR at 3%
* 30 sec AO at 1%

Block 3 - 5.5 mins

* 45 sec base at 4% (I think - otherwise its starts at 6% and goes to 12%)
* 45 sec base at 6%
* 45 sec base at 8%
* 45 sec base at 10%
* 30 sec AO at 11%
* 30 sec WR at 11%
* 30 sec AO at 13%
* 30 sec WR at 13%
* 30 sec AO at 15% (pretty much at base pace at this point!)
* WR
* *Cry and say farewell to your calves* üëãüëã  


**ROWEY**

Block 1 - 4 mins

* 4 min row for distance (remember distance)

Block 2 - 2.5 mins

* 30 sec AO row
* 30 sec rowcovery
* 30 sec AO row
* 30 sec rowcovery
* 30 sec AO row

Block 3 - 5.5 mins

* 1 min AO row (self-timed)
* 25 x pulse squats
* *Repeat until time, try to reach distance from first block*  


**FLOORY - one big block**  
Complex exercises - use same dumbbells and move through exercises continuously (go on the heavy side so you don't end up doing burpees for 8 mins)

* 6 x upright row
* 6 x front squat
* 6 x shoulder press
* 6 x reverse lunge

Round 1 - 2 rounds complex exercises + 10 x burpee to bicep curl

Round 2 - 2 rounds complex exercises + 10 x burpee with plank jack

Round 3 - 2 rounds complex exercises + 10 full burpees (chest to floor)

Round 4 - Complete burpee exercises only starting at 10/8/6/etc

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully the format makes sense - if me and my tight calves got through this you can too!! üß°üß°",1602133285

  ##Saturday 26 June 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
I‚Äôm going to say it.. its another doozy today. The only plus about the 2G today is that there is no rowing and no pushes. That‚Äôs about it. Everything else is either difficult or awkward.

On the tread mill it is high inclines at base pace with one minute all outs to cap the blocks. The incline efforts (at base) start at 90 seconds and then reduce but it is a pretty challenging tread block.

The floor has a lot of core work and then just lower body for the rest of it. I am not a huge fan of lunges and there are a lot of lunges today. With the weights work, the first exercise is always weighted and the second is body weight only. However, I added weights to the squats to make it a bit more strength focused. We also substituted the pivot lunge at the end with pulse lunges.

Wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the template but it is pretty tough with the tread block. I could have skipped the floor and not given it another thought. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

**Tread Block 1**
* 90 sec base @ 5%
* 1 min base

  ##Friday 25 June 2021 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
Another doozy today and does feel a bit like another 12 minute prep. The tread block is pretty simple - everything is a 3 minute run for distance with walking recoveries in between. The floor features mini bands so expect to feel your glutes for the next couple of days. 

On the tread I would suggest try playing with your paces. See if you can start at your push pace and continue to increase it with every block. You do get a minute to walk in between the efforts so you have some recovery. I‚Äôm not sure on the last 2 minute walk but it did seem a long time to allow the floor to get the rowers. If you want a gauge on how far you can get, I did 5.238 km (not including the warmup). 

On the floor it is alternating mini bands with weighted exercises. The last block is the only row block you will get which is a 3 minute row for distance. They are all designed to minimize the transitions between exercises so the challenge is to just push through all exercises in the 3 minutes you have for the block.

All in all it wasn‚Äôt much of a relief from yesterday. The only redeeming point was that there was no inclines. I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness, mainly for the six 3 minute run for distances.

  ##Thursday 24 June 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
I knew that the template designers had something in mind after giving us that gentle template yesterday (well I thought it was gentle!). Today is like a precursor to the 12 minute run for distance! I quite enjoyed the class but it is definitely a lot tougher than yesterday. If you are in the 2G then there is hardly any rowing and to be honest felt like prep for the 200m row benchmark coming up soon in July.

On the treadmill you have two blocks. The first block is pretty brutal, four 2 minute pushes with one minute base in between but it ends with a 2 minute push to 1 minute all out! The second block mixes up strength and power so it is all outs at incline! If you want to test yourself on the first block, I did my normal push, base and all out and was about 10% off my 12 minute run distance. Give it a go and see how you feel knowing that for the benchmark you will have a bit more energy to give it. On the second block, if you are feeling good on the all outs see if you can keep the incline or increase it. Pretty good 2G tread block, I ended up running over 3 miles (just shy of 5km) not including the warmup so you should get some good distance on the treads.

On the floor it is a lot of single arm strength work using explosive tempo to get some of the power in. On the second block I would go for lighter weights as the reps are quite high. As a benchmark I used weights probably half of what I would do on a normal bicep curl and I was still feeling the burn.

All in all a tasty little ESP template, plenty for everyone and has enough to challenge anyone. I give this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Wednesday June 23 2021 2G Workout by u/MsInternationalLife  
So I am bad at remembering the full template but the 2g was 4 5 min blocks

Block 1 and 3 were 160m run followed by 100m row and repeat (all ao) 

Block 2 and 4 on treadmill were 30sec all out followed by 45 sec recovery 

On the floor 

Block 2 and 4 were timed with treads (2 was clean to front squat followed by 24 alt jump things and rest and then 4 was alt lunges followed by 24 high knees and rest. 

Block 1 and 3 were reps. Block 1 was 6 ea of static lunges and then 8 of a core exercise. Block 3 was 6 ea of single arm hip hinge then 8 of a core. 

(Sorry for formatting and not remembering it all)",1624424424

  ##Tuesday 22 June 2021 - Strength (endurance) 2G 60 minutes  
Hope everyone had a good Inferno day as OTF has decided to treat us with an awesome strength template. This features some tasty runs at incline, very few rows and the ab dolly with pikes and knee tucks makes its return! Something for everyone!

The treadmill block is pretty brutal. 2 min run for distances at incline, a one minute all out. Plenty of distance on offer here (I managed 5km / 3.1 miles during the block which is pretty good for a strength session). My suggestion is to try and hold your push pace for the run for distances and then increase the speed if you are feeling good at the end. We were coached to continue to increase our push pace on the runs which I think is doable given the times are getting shorter. The last all out will be a struggle but you have some solace that it is the end of the treadmill work. 

The floor is pretty good. All upper body with some ab dolly work at the end. The rows all have a stroke rate challenge but our coach just let us go hell for leather.

All in all I thought this was a good template but pretty challenging. I give this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 28 October 2021 - Hell Week #5 ‚ÄúEncrypted Elevation‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
This is a high energy template where there is very little rest anywhere on the template. I quite enjoyed it but it made it difficult to keep up with all the transitions. More inclines but they are randomly allocated.

On the treadmill, the coach basically gets given a random incline for you to do all your blocks. It will be anywhere up to 15%. My group got 4% but one of the others got 2% so it is pretty random as to what you get. All blocks are the same - 1 minute push, 30 sec base, 90 sec run for distance, all at the same incline. You get a 45 sec walking recovery in between each block.

The row follows the tread from a timing perspective. 1 minute of ground to presses with the medicine ball, 30 seconds to transition to rower and then a 90 second all out row. 

The floor is all body weight with no rest. When the treads and rowers are doing their recovery you are doing alternating lunges with rotations. If you do this properly you should be getting quite a few splats on the floor. I think I remember someone asking for rolling burpees - your prayers have been answered!

I didn‚Äôt think today was as bad as yesterday but then again I didn‚Äôt get a massive incline (imagine if you got 10%+!!). I give this a 1 (ü™∂) for gentleness and a  3 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 for hell week templates.

Edit: I‚Äôve changed the description on the floor. They are lateral step overs not the hop overs so you are standing upright the whole time.

  ##Tuesday 26 October 2021 - Hell Week #3 ‚ÄúRow for Ransom‚Äù 2G/3G 60 minutes  
I promise to ask Mrs DC to do a 2G a lot sooner than the 6pm class next time. It looks like there were a few surprises for those who got to see her 2G intel later in the day than normal. The 2G was definitely a lot harder than the 3G yesterday. 

Today there is only the single template as they have folded in a special rowing benchmark as part of the class. A special 14 minute row for distance! Definitely the focus of the day is the benchmark row so if you can, I suggest getting on the rower first so your legs are still fresh.

For the treads, you have 12 all outs. I didn‚Äôt think this was too bad. Still plenty of splats but at least the walking recovery was not at a stupid incline. If you are doing the treads first, consider easing off a little on the all outs as you have the row block next. None of the all outs are a minute and there is no incline (yay!).

On the rower, it is a single block - 14 minutes long. My suggestion is to switch to the pacing mode of the monitor so you can see how fast you are doing the 500m blocks in. I did struggle on this after the run and was in orange and red for pretty much the entire block. The furthest girl in the studio did 3.8km and the furthest guy did 4.2km if you are interested in comparing.

The floor is all arms and core. I didn‚Äôt think it was too bad but a lot of people who started on the treads lost their will to see out the template and all left well before the end.

Today‚Äôs template is rougher than yesterday‚Äôs 3G but way better than the 2G. I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness and 3 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 as a hell week guide.

  ##Monday 25 October 2021 - Hell Week #2 ‚ÄúThe Burpee Breach‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
I‚Äôm going to be controversial and say that this wasn‚Äôt too bad even with the neverending burpees. Maybe it was because yesterday was so hard but this didn‚Äôt feel as bad. Hard yes but not as bad as the first hell week template.

The tread block features a lot of distance runs. The first block has 30 sec walking recoveries and the second block you are trying to match your distance but with an increasing incline challenge. Oh and 30 seconds less. 

The row block is a partner workout with some restercise whilst the partner is rowing. Last 2 minutes is a distance row in time with the treads and floor.

The floor is just loads of burpees of differing varieties - ultimate, full, bicep curls, shoulder presses etc. They are timed so you will end up doing quite a few of them if you are fast enough.

Edit: Ultimate burpee is the following. Starting with the dumbbells at your side, kick out into the high plank, do a push up, do a low row on each side, kick back into a standing position and then do a full thruster.

Still a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness and a 2 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 as a hell week template.

**Tread Block 1**
* Reset your monitor
* 2 min run for distance
* 30 sec WR
* 90sec run for distance
* 30 sec WR
* 1 min AO
* 30 sec WR
* 30 sec AO - pause and record distance

**Tread Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* Reset your monitor
* 1 min run for distance
* 1 min run for distance @ 2%
* 1 min run for distance @ 3%
* 1 min run for distance @ 4%
* 2 min run for distance @ 1%
* Try to beat your distance from block 1

**Row Block - 14 minutes**
* Partner the rower next to you
* 3 rounds of: Partner A does 24 total x alternating reverse lunge, Partner B rows - swap so that each partner does 3 rounds of exercises
* 3 rounds of: Partner A does 20 x squat jacks, Partner B rows - swap so that each partner does 3 rounds of exercises
* Repeat until the final 2 minutes: Partner A does 16 x squat jumps, Partner B rows - swap
* Final 2 minutes: Reset and row for distance

**Floor Block 1**
* 2 min x ultimate burpee
* 30 sec x iso squat hold
* 90 sec x burpee to bicep curl to shoulder press
* 30 sec x iso squat hold
* 1 min x burpee to bicep curl
* 30 sec x iso squat hold
* 30 sec x normal burpee

**Floor Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* 4 minutes of:
* 20 total x bench hop over
* 10 total x bench step up
* 5 x squat jack
* For last 2 minutes: full burpee",1635138029

  ##Sunday 24 October 2021 - Hell Week #1 Phishing for Rest 3G 60 minutes  
Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) did the 3G version of this hell week template and its just as hard as the 2G. No rest whatsoever through out any of the blocks. Still a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness and a 4 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 for Hell Week (I will go and correct my comment in the other early intel). Very difficult as you are pretty much at a push to all out throughout the template.

I added the 15% walking recovery at the end of the tread blocks 1 and 2. For the rows I think you get a minute break between them.

**Tread Block 1**

  ##Saturday 23 October 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Today is the day that late cancelling is definitely on the cards. It almost made me wish that I did have early intel and I would have taken this as a rest day ahead of Hell Week. Having said that it was quite a nice template but again I question the template designers in their thinking - why put a strength / endurance session straight after CMIYC??

The tread block is pretty tortuous. I took it easy (after CMIYC yesterday) and still made 3 miles in the run. It is progressive inclines on the push efforts with some base in between. The run for distances at the end of each block are at the max incline (5%!) so my suggestion is to just do it at your all out feeling and try to maintain the push speeds you had during the block.

The floor block was actually quite good. Good opportunities to lift heavy. Only a little bit of rowing. This was much more my style compared to the weird core blocks we have had recently. On the single leg lateral step up the weight is carried only in one arm (hence the single arm).

Even though it was torture (I am writing this as I ice my hamstrings) I quite liked this template. I still think I would have taken a rest day if I had the chance but I do feel better having had a bit of a run. I rate this template a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. If you did do CMIYC yesterday then have no guilt about cancelling this class.

Mrs DC is doing the 3G so will post that up soon.

  ##Sunday 27 December 2020 - Endurance 2G  
First session back after the mini Christmas break and it is an endurance template! Nice long runs on the treadmill and its pretty much all lower body on the floor.

  ##Thursday 24 December 2020 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Christmas Eve workout is a bit of a doozy - lots of short blocks and runoing up inclines and power rows. The walking/rowing recovery between blocks is only 45 seconds so not a lot of time to rest. The aim is to beat your distances on each of the 90 second blocks (is pretty hard on the treadmill with the increasing incline unless you pace yourself on the earlier blocks). Furthest anyone got on the row was around 560m.

**Tread Block 1**

* 90 sec run for distance @ 4% (record your distance)

**Tread Block 2**

* 45 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Tread Block 3**

* 90 sec run for distance @ 5% (try and beat your previous distance)

**Tread Block 4**

* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Tread Block 5**

* 90 sec run for distance @ 6% (try and beat your previous distance)

**Row Block 1**

* 90 sec row for distance (record your distance)

**Row Block 2**

* 5 x squat
* 10 x speed skater lunges
* Repeat, adding 5 reps to the squats each round

**Row Block 3**

* 90 sec row for distance (try to beat your previous distance)

**Row Block 4**

* 10 x squats
* 10 x speed skater lunges
* Repeat, adding 10 reps to the skater lunges each round

**Row Block 5**

* 90 sec row for distance (try to beat your previous distance)

**Floor Block 1 - 90 seconds**

* 5 x sumo squat
* 5 x squat jack

**Floor Block 2 - 3 minutes**

* 6 x static lunge bicep curl (left leg)
* 6 x static lunge upper cut (right leg)
* 12 x hip hinge reverse grip low row

**Floor Block 3 - 90 seconds**

* 5 x sumo squat
* 5 x squat jack

**Floor Block 4 - 3.5 minutes**

* 6 x static lunge bicep curl (left leg)

  ##Monday 21 December 2020 - Power 2G 60 minutes  
Nice template today to challenge your all out paces. Plenty of rest in  between blocks so if you want to challenge yourself try to get back to base as soon as your heart rate starts to get to that blue/green. We were coached to try to add a little bit to each of the final block of all outs given we had so much walking recovery in between.

Our coach modified the first floor block to give us some extra rowing in between the sets (we did 200m rows after three rounds of the repeating exercises, another after another 2 and then a final row at the end).

**Tread Block 1**

* Reset treadmill
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 45 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 45 sec AO
* Record your distance

**Tread Block 2**

* Reset treadmill
* 45 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 45 sec push

Still felt more like an endurance template today with two long tread blocks with push inclines. The floor was pretty much all with the bosu with some stabilising exercises. No rowing in the 2G today.

Two tough-ish classes in a row! The good news is that there are no 30 second all outs, the bad news is that they are all one minute! You also have some pushes on inclines. The rower is pretty tough as well. There are also splats on the floor with burpees and jump lunges.

  ##Wednesday 16 December 2020 - Power 3G (500m row benchmark) 60 minutes  
Benchmark day! There is a large thread on the 500m row tactics but my advice is to just go all out as hard as you can for the distance. It is a bit like the mile benchmark.. just a bit too long for a sprint but too short to be an endurance challenge. If I can move my legs after the row then I think I haven't gone hard enough. I would focus on short power strokes and just go hard and fast.

The first three blocks are switched through quickly so that everyone gets a turn on the rower without getting too fatigued first.

On the last tread block our coach said we could just do a 1 minute all out if we wanted to... a few people took him up on it.

**Tread Block 1 - 4 minutes**

* 160 m (0.1 miles) run
* 15-30 sec WR
* Repeat, adding 1% to incline each round

**Row Block 1 - 4 minutes**

* 500m row (record time)
* Body weight squats until time

**Floor Block 1 - 4 minutes**

* 8 x squat
* 4 x walkout to push up
* 8 x sprinter sit up

**Tread Block 2**

* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec AO
* 1 min WR
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec AO
* 30 sec WR
* 30 sec push
* 30 sec AO

**Row Block 2 - 7 minutes**

* 400m row
* 14 x reverse lunge with rotation
* 300m row
* 14 x reverse lunge with rotation
* 200m row
* 14 x reverse lunge with rotation
* 100m row
* 14 x reverse lunge with rotation
* Repeat the 100m block until time

  ##Sunday 6 December 2020 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
Really liked this template, nice little mix of everything. Treadmill had a nice little hill climb for the second block and all the blocks featured a 90 sec run for distance at the end of them (no all outs!). Probably safe for hangovers given you can set your own pace for the run for distance.

Floor blocks are not bad.. if you are missing the rowing then just do them at the start of each round. The only exercise I didn't particularly like was the plank kick through but they are pretty easy to modify.

**Tread Block 1**

* 1 min push
* 30 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 1 min base
* 2 min push
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Tread Block 2**

* 1 min base @ 2%
* 1 min base @ 3%
* 1 min base @ 4%
* 1 min base @ 5%
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Tread Block 3**

* 1 min push
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Floor Block 1 - 9 minutes**

* 200m row (24 strokes per minute) - once only (unless you do the row at the start of each round)
* 12 x alternating shoulder press with rotation
* 12 / 10 / 8 x TRX jump squat
* 6 each x suitcase squat

**Floor Block 2 - 7 minutes**

* 200m row (count your strokes) - once only
* 8 each x hollow hold single arm close grip chest press
* 12 / 10 / 8 x alternating pop squat
* 12 x plank kick through

**Floor Block 3 - 4 minutes**

  ##Saturday 5 December 2020 - Endurance/Power 2G 60 minutes  
Really nice workout today, only one one minute all out, the rest are all pretty much 30 seconds. Loads of base pace and walking recoveries. Good if you do have a hangover from Friday night as it is not that challenging. If you want to make it harder than do a much more aggressive push on tread block 1 and go a little faster on the all outs.

The floor is all power moves plus TRX work, nothing too challenging in there other than a small set of burpees to start you off. The last row block is timed with the treadmills and is also not too bad.

**Tread Block 1**

* 30 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec push
* 75 sec base
* 30 sec push

* 30 sec AO

* 30 sec AO
* 30 sec WR
* 45 sec AO
* 45 sec WR
* 1 min AO
* 1 min WR

**Tread Block 3**

* 30 sec AO
* 75 sec WR
* 30 sec AO
* 75 sec WR
* 30 sec AO
* 75 sec WR
* 30 sec AO

**Floor Block 1 - 7 minutes**

* 10 x full burpee once only
* 6 each side x lateral step up with power
* 6 each side x bench single arm reverse fly
* 6 x lateral raise to front raise

**Floor Block 2 - 7.5 minutes**

  ##Tuesday 19 January 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Nice ESP template today. There are no all outs today. Instead you are doing a push pace but at an incline of your choosing - feel free to pick one that will give you an all out feeling for the 30 seconds you are doing it. The floor isn't too offensive with the only one that I hate being the bench static lunge. Not a huge amount of splats on the floor so go hard on the treadmill and rower.

**Tread Block 1**

* 30 sec push
* 30 sec base
* 30 sec push
* 30 sec push @ your choice of incline (AO)

  ##Sunday 17 January 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Yesterday was a killer for the legs and today's run/row is going to do it again and add in some upper body for good measure. The run row has some moderate inclines with short distances so it kind of feels more like a power session. The floor has some good opportunities to go heavy with only a short block of mini band work before you get into the chest, back and arms workout.

If you get to the bonus round (160m + 100m row) I think the most rounds anyone did in our class was 8 (might have been starting the 8th bonus round).

  ##Saturday 16 January 2021 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
First off.. for those who have been complaining about not enough lower body work you will need to apologise to your legs today. It is all lower body today with long pushes and rows and a heap of squats on the floor. Today is pretty rough but at least there are no inclines! The shortest (and only) all out is the 90 second run for distance (our coach tells us that these are just all outs) at the end of each tread block. 

For the TRX exercises on the floor we just substituted these for ab dolly work. The TRX is too fiddly to get in and out of. I don't think I made it through the third round of exercises so my suggestion is that if you want to finish the three rounds maybe use lighter weights and power through it. May also be a good idea if you are doing the tread block straight after the floor (but then you have those rows as well...)

Enjoy.. you may need an ice bath afterwards...

**Tread Block 1**

* 3 min push
* 1 min base
* 3 min push
* 90 sec base
* 3 min push
* 2 min base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Tread Block 2**

* 3 min push
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec run for distance

**Floor Block - 11.5 minutes**

* Exercise group 1: Sumo goblet squats, sumo squats, step out squat
* Exercise group 2: TRX knee tuck, TRX plank in and out
* Round 1: 10 reps of group 1 and 2
* Round 2: 2 x 8 reps of group 1 and 2
* Round 3: 3 x 6 reps of group 1 and 2

**Row Block**

* 90 sec AO row
* 90 sec recovery
* 3 min AO row (try to double your previous distance)
* 90 sec recovery
* 90 sec AO row (match or beat the first row or half the second)",1610776836

  ##Friday 15 January 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Pretty straight forward template today. Rower is your endurance block with those flamingo like poses. Treadmill is all strength and power. I personally didn't get any splats on the rower (mainly because those balance exercises take me forever and my heart rate drops too much) so you may need to go harder on the treadmill (ie get back to base on the second block). The floor is also pretty straight forward with some tempo strength moves and power through the ground to press and bicep curls.

**Tread Block 1**

* 1 min push @ 5%
* 45 sec base
* 1 min push @ 4%
* 45 sec base
* 1 min push @ 3%

* 1 min WR
* 30 sec push
* 30 sec AO
* 1 min WR
* 30 sec push

**Row Block - 14 minutes**

* 30 sec AO row
* 16 x iso squat medicine ball bicep curl
* 8 x balance on left leg medicine ball side to side
* 8 x balance on right leg medicine ball side to side
* 1 min AO row
* 16 x iso squat medicine ball bicep curl
* 8 x balance on left leg medicine ball side to side
* 8 x balance on right leg medicine ball side to side
* 90 sec row
* 16 x iso squat medicine ball bicep curl
* 8 x balance on left leg medicine ball side to side
* 8 x balance on right leg medicine ball side to side
* Repeat for the entire block

**Floor Block 1 - 6 minutes**

**Floor Block 2 - 6.5 minutes**

  ##Thursday 14 January 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Today is a run/rest (run/row on the 2G). Nice little power session with plenty of splats on offer on the treadmill, rower and floor. The only weights you will face is for the reverse lunge to neutral half thruster (note it is a half and not a full). For an extra challenge, add 1% incline to each round in the bonus treadmill block. 

For the runs, if you can't hold an all out pace for the full 400m, try with an aggressive push and add speed to each run. For the shortest runs this should be an all out. It is also up to a 30 second walking recovery but if you get your breath back quick then just start up again.

I did see the 2G card. Basically the same but at the end of the 400m run you do a 100m row, 320m run you do a 150m row, 240m run do a 200m row and the 160m run do a 250m row. I think the bonus rounds had 100m rows. My preference would have been to do a run/row but was happy with a 3G.

**Tread Block - 14 minutes**

* Round 1:
* 400m (0.25 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* 320m (0.2 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* 240m (0.15 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* 160m (0.1 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* Round 2: 
* 320m (0.2 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* 240m (0.15 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* 160m (0.1 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* Round 3:
* 240m (0.15 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* 160m (0.1 mile) run
* max 30 sec WR
* Bonus: 160m (0.1 mile) run, max 30 sec WR - see how many you can get

**Row Block 1 - 4 minutes**

* 100m row + 10 medicine ball power jacks
* Repeat until time, adding 50m to the row each time

**Row Block 2 - 3.5 minutes**

* 100m row + 10 medicine ball power jacks
* Repeat until time, adding 2 power jacks each round

**Row Block 3 - 3.5 minutes**

* 30 sec AO row, 15 sec recovery row
* Repeat until time, check distance at end

Nice class today before the benchmark tomorrow. Nothing too strenuous and you should be able to up your paces a bit if you want to hit your heart rate target. Only three 30 second all outs, longest push is 90 seconds so they are being kind on us today for the treadmills. Floor block is all body weight exercises and only a short block of burpees that will bump your heart rate up.

  ##5 January 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Today is another run/row (or run/rest for the 3G) day but with inclines! Rowers have similar formats with alternating 100/200m rows with exercises or rest in between. The floor is pretty tame so I think the focus is on the run and the rowing today. As with all run/rests I would suggest that you only walk long enough to get your heart rate back under control.

I did see the 2G run row card if you have a choice of class:

23 minutes / 160m run + 100m row, each round increase the run by 160m and the row by 100m. The run incline increases by 1% after each 160m. Complete 6 rounds of this and then run for distance. The final distance is 960m with an incline of 6% and a 600m row. Looks pretty mental!

**Tread Block - 14 minutes**

* 160m (0.1 mile run)
* 30 sec WR
* 320m (0.2 mile run), increasing incline by 1% after every 160m finishing at 2%
* 45 sec WR
* 480m (0.3 mile run), increasing incline by 1% after every 160m finishing at 3%
* 1 min WR
* 640m (0.4 mile run), increasing incline by 1% after every 160m finishing at 4%
* 75 sec WR
* 800m (0.5 mile run), increasing incline by 1% after every 160m finishing at 5%
* Reset monitor and run for distance @ 1%

**Row Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 100m row + 15 lateral hops
* 200m row + 30 lateral hops
* Repeat the above until time

**Row Block 2 - 6 minutes**

* 100m row (count strokes), recovery row for half the strokes
* 200m row (count strokes), recovery row for half the strokes

**Floor BLock 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 6 x goblet squat (go for max weight)
* 12 x plank alternating leg lift

**Floor Block 2 - 6 minutes**

* 6 x static lunge (left leg) to bicep curl
* 6 x static lunge (right leg) to upper cut
* 12 x plank bird dog",1609826433

  ##Sunday 28 March 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
This is a pretty tough one today. Long runs at incline. Long rows with power exercises. Floor has heaps of compound exercises on the bosu. I did a double today so also have the 2G intel. I think the 2G is a little bit harder because it is a run/row but I got more splats on the 3G. Both are pretty challenging.

On the treads I suggest if you can do your push pace on the long runs then do it. I increased my speed on the runs as the distance decreased and finished on all outs. The run for distance at the end I started at base and then moved to push and all out for the last 30 seconds. The one minute walking recovery between efforts is a guideline only, I would just get yourself close to green and then just start again (was around 30 seconds for me).

Furthest distance on the tread (for the run for distance) was 350m. Furthest distance on the row for distance was 520m.

  ##Wednesday 17 March 2021 - Endurance (Luck of the Draw) 3G 60 minutes  
Fun little template today. Essentially the luck of the draw relates to what distance you get on either your 90 second run or row for distance. Odd distance you do a specific exercise, evens something thing else. Everything is also 17 themed.. the distances are either 0.17 miles on the treadmill or 170m on the rower or 17 reps on the floor.

I quite enjoyed this. You can go as hard as you want (given it is endurance) and it is challenging enough that you will get all your splats. I rate this a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

The 2G is a run/row. There must be an tread block first and then the card said that it was a 14 block where odds you had a 1.6km run + 273m run / 30 sec WR and evens you had a 1700m row and then repeat 17 over head press + 170m rows until time. Think I would prefer the run!

**Tread Block 1**
* 90 sec run for distance - record your distance

**Tread Block 2 - 11 minutes**
* If your distance from block 1 was odd then you do the following:
* 1.6 km (1 mile) run 
* Then repeat: 273m (0.17 mile) run + 30 sec WR
* If your distance from block 1 was even then you do the following:
* 5 rounds of 273m (0.17 mile) run + 30 sec WR
* Once finished then run for distance

**Row Block 1**
* 90 sec row for distance - record your distance

**Row Block 2 - 11 minutes**
* If your distance from block 1 was odd then you do the following:
* 5 rounds of 17 medicine ball overhead press and 170m row. Once finished row for distance
* If your distance from block 1 was even then you do the following:
* 1700m row
* Repeat until time: 170m row + 17 x medicine ball overhead press

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**
* 3 rounds of:
* 12 x front squat
* 6 each side x TRX single leg dead lift
* Once finished, do 17 x TRX knee tuck (option use ab dolly)
* 3 rounds of:
* 12 x alternating lateral lunge
* 6 each x TRX single leg squat
* Once finished, do 17 x TRX knee tuck (option use ab dolly)
* If finished then repeat all exercises as a single block",1615957268

  ##Tuesday 16 March 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Nice template today. All the inclines are at push or all out pace for the tread block. You have one long row block today with a number of short rows to start with a row for distance challenge at the end (furthest in our class was just over 1400m). The floor has something for all muscle groups with squats, dead lifts, bicep curls. 

I didn‚Äôt think it would be too hard when the coach was walking through it but I ended up with over 25 splats! I would rate this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness mainly because of the row and tread block.

The 2G is a run row. I had a sneak peek at the tread card and it is 2 blocks of 10.5 minutes. First block is a 160m (0.1 mile) run + 100m row, 320m (0.2 mile) run @ 2% + 100m row, 480m (0.3 mile) run @ 4% + 100m row, run for distance @ 6%. Second block reverses it - 480m run @ 4% + 100m row, 320m run @ 2% + 100m row, 160m run + 100m row, run for distance - try to beat block 1 distance.

**Tread Block 1**
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 2%

  ##15 March 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Today is the load and explode template. On the treadmill it is essentially pushes to all outs and then on the floor it is heavy weights followed by a power move. The rower they will get you to count strokes and then do 100m all out rows. The whole idea is that you load yourself up before doing the explosive power moves (e.g push to all out, stroke count before all out row, heavy weight before a power move).

I didn‚Äôt find today particularly hard but I think that is because of all the walking recoveries. With the heavy weights on the floor and the rowing I would give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. I think if you go heavy on the floor and follow up with the power move straight away you will get splats on the floor.

  ##Sunday 14 March 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Nice strength block today. The tread block is challenging but not as bad as yesterday. Most of the block is at base pace but it has some nasty all outs on incline (again you can use the all out feeling if you aren't going to do an all out pace). Highest incline is up to 8% (though it is your choice to do that) for a couple of minutes. The floor has minimal rowing (only 2 rows of 200m) but will test out your chest and back if you choose to go heavy.

Today I give this a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness - mainly for the high inclines and one minute all outs.

**Tread Block 1**

* 90 sec push
* 1 min base
* 2 min base @ 4%
* 1 min base
* 1 min AO @ 4%

**Tread Block 2**

* 90 sec push
* 75 sec base
* 90 sec base @ 5%
* 75 sec base
* 1 min AO @ 5%

**Tread Block 3**

* 90 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 1 min base @ 6-8% (your choice of incline)
* 90 sec base
* 1 min AO @ 6-8% (your choice of incline)

**Floor Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 200m AO row (once only)
* 5 each side x bench single arm high row
* 10 x push up to alternating rotation

**Floor Block 2 - 6.5 minutes**

* 200m AO row (once only)

  ##Friday 12 March 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
A bit of a strength and power focused session today. I didn't find it too challenging. The hill climbs were all at base with the highest incline at 6%. The power block is pretty manageable as well. The floor is all core (ab dolly is back) and legs. You can load up the weights on the squats if you want more of a challenge.

I rated today's workout a 4 ( ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ) / 5 feathers. Plenty of walking, the row is broken up with exercises and the floor only had a few hard moves (no pikes!)

**Tread Block 1**

* 1 min base @ 2%
* 1 min base @ 3%
* 1 min base @ 4%
* 1 min base @ 5%

* 75 sec WR
* 1 min AO
* 1 min WR
* 45 sec AO

* 100m row + 10 front to back shuffles
* 300m row + 30 lateral hops

* 100m row + 10 lateral hops
* 300m row + 30 front jacks
* 200m row + 20 front jacks

  ##Thursday 11 March 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice power template today, not too challenging as all it features is 30 second all outs and pushes. Heaps of walking recoveries as well. As always if you find this too easy get back to base earlier and also try just holding your all out for the minute instead of the 30 seconds. Extra points if you add some incline.

Rower also wasn‚Äôt too bad.. first and third blocks are in time with the treadmill. Again, if it isn‚Äôt too hard then just do all out rows for the full minute instead push rows. 

Floor will stress your arms and lower back but I didn‚Äôt it was too bad. No funny complex moves today, just old school clean and press and low rows.

Today I gave it a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) feathers out of 5 for gentleness. I did get plenty of splats but that was because I chose to go a little harder on the treadmill and rower.

  ##Wednesday 10 March 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
For all those missing lower body exercises then today is your day. Goblet squats, deadlifts, sumo deadlifts, front squats etc. The OTF template designers have unfortunately gone for some funky combinations again but I reckon just go old school on them and just do the normal variations.

Tread block isn‚Äôt too bad, highest incline is only 7% and it is only for 30 seconds. I did ask the coach if he was going to make us do it all again at push pace and he just laughed. Only base pace for us today.

Row block is pretty long and you will definitely get splats on it.

I rate today‚Äôs template a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of five. The rows made it a little more difficult but not overly so.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec base @ 2%
* 30 sec base @ 3%
* 30 sec base @ 4%
* 30 sec base @ 5%
* 30 sec base @ 6%
* 30 sec base @ 7%
* 1 min base @ 1%
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 2**
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec base @ 7%
* 30 sec base @ 6%
* 30 sec base @ 5%
* 30 sec base @ 4%
* 30 sec base @ 3%
* 30 sec base @ 2%
* 30 sec base @ 1%
* 30 sec AO

**Row Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**
* 1000m row
* 20 x curtsey lunge
* Row for distance
* Record total distance

**Row Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* 30 sec AO row + 10 x curtsey lunge, 10 x medicine ball good morning
* Repeat until time
* Try to beat half your distance from block 1

**Floor Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**
* 8 x sumo squat to upright row
* 8 x front squat
* 8 x dead lift to low row

  ##Tuesday 9 March 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Nice endurance block today though was reasonably tough coming off the 1 mile benchmark. Longest run is a 2 minute run for distance but it comes off a long base. The rows were reasonably difficult as well if you want to get far into the bonus rounds. Furthest anyone got this morning was to finish the 600m round with the tricep extensions. The floor also had no rest so expect a few splats there.

I would rate today 2 ü™∂ü™∂ out of 5. Pretty tough.

**Tread Block**
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 2 min push
* 1 min base

  ##Thursday 4 March 2021 - Infinity 3G 60 minutes  
Today is a sneaky benchmark day. The rower component will be tracked in your challenges. My suggestion is to start on the rower if you can and then do the floor and tread. Don't be like me and start on the floor and have the rower last!

 To be honest you will get splats across all stations as every single part of this work out is challenging. I would also time how long it takes you to do 2 rounds of floor exercises as this will give you a good gauge as to how fast you can do this in dri tri. If you can do that in less than 6 minutes then that is a pretty good time.

To round off the good news the coach told us that Monday is the 1.6km (1 mile) benchmark again.. can't wait...

For the competitive types out there the fastest on the floor was 4 minutes 50 seconds. Furthest distances on the rower was just over 3k and the longest run was just over 4 km. My suggestion is don't kill yourself on the run if you are going to be doing the rower next as that is also quite challenging.

This template is 1 / 5 on the gentleness scale.. super challenging.

**Tread Block**

* 3 min push
* 90 sec base
* 2 min push
* 90 sec base
* 2 min push
* 90 sec base
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec AO

**Row Block - 14 minutes**

* 100m row + 20 medicine ball power jacks
* Repeat, decreasing rep count by 2 on the power jacks
* If you get down to 2 reps, go back up again

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**

* 40 x bench hop overs
* 20 x bench tap squats
* 20 each side x bench step up
* 20 x push up
* 20 x plank jack
* 10 x burpee
* Repeat until time",1614837653

  ##Monday 3 May 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
After a nice relaxing Sunday we are back to inclines! It‚Äôs a doozy today featuring run and row for distance challenges. I think you will get splat points all across the stations today as even the floor has some challenging moves.

The treadmill has a little surprise that we didn‚Äôt see coming. The first distance goal is a 3 minute run for distance but then you back it up with a 5 minute round where you have to match your distance on massive inclines. Last couple of rounds are just flat road efforts. I didn‚Äôt go too hard on the first run for distance (847m) but saw a few of the guys who got close to a 1 km really regret their life choices on the next block. On the inclines, I would start a bit under your base pace and increase speed as the inclines drop. You should be able to do something between your base and your push on the last incline.

The row is also pretty challenging with a distance goal after the 3 minute row but with squat jacks as the restercise (!!). The last couple of rows are in time with the treads and are just all outs.

The floor is pretty challenging with burpees to squat jacks, ground to presses, plank jacks, pushups and pull ups. You should be able to get splats here as well. 

For today‚Äôs workout I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness - it really felt like a Mayhem teaser.

Get ready for a cardio blast on all three stations.  The floor is by far the hardest one, I was in the red zone the entire first block

- 3 min run for distance
- 90s WR, record distance above and try to beat in the next 5 min with inclines

- Recovery then 1min all out row, do half the distance

Floor block 1: 12.5 min

- Bench squat jacks 8/10/12 reps
- Pushups to plank jacks on bench 8 reps

  ##28 April 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
I am so disappointed that my rest day coincided with the Everest prep day ;) Today is a pretty gentle power session. Mostly all outs with some power moves on the floor.

The tread block is fairly standard. Only a couple of pushes to all outs and the last block features a single one minute all out then they get easier. For those doing marathon month I did 3.276 km (2.05 miles) in the tread section by jogging the walking recoveries.

The row is pretty tough, especially the first block. Only five people in our class got to the squat hold.

Floor is reasonably easy - I wouldn‚Äôt be too stressed about any of the exercises there.

For today‚Äôs template I rate it a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. If you want to go hard on the rower to get the squat holds go for it but I didn‚Äôt think it was that hard overall.

  ##Sunday 25 April 2021 - ESP 60 minutes 2G  
For the fellow Aussies and Kiwis out there - hope you are having a good ANZAC day there and are doing something for our national day of remembrance. For today‚Äôs template it is nasty ESP with loads of inclines on the treadmill. Not much rowing today but you do have a bit of mini band work on the floor.

The treadmill is by far the hardest bit of this template, especially the first 13 or so minutes with long pushes into one minute all outs. You do have 90 second walking recoveries which I think you may need all of. I got back to base for each one as I find 90 seconds a little too long but you will need quite a bit of it. The second block is not that much better as it is just increasing inclines for the all outs. My suggestion is that you can bring down the speed if you want to get to the all out feeling. If you are feeling adventurous then just keep the speeds up. For those doing marathon month, I did 5.05 km (3.15 miles) on the tread today outside of the warmup. Since everyone asks I do a 14kmh (8.75 mph) base, 16 kmh (10 mph) push and a 18-20kmh (11.25 - 12.5 mph) all out. I also just kept my speeds constant throughout the tread block.

The floor block does have mini-bands but no monster walks so I found them pretty doable. For those missing their upper body work, it is all upper body today. For the 200m rows, the coach was watching everyone and told everyone to get their rows in under a minute. I treated them as all out rows and tried to get them all done in or just under the 30 sec mark. The rows will get your heart rate back up so you should get some splats on the floor.

I found the first half of the treadmill block probably the toughest and for that I give today a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

**Tread Block 1**
* 3 min push
* 1 min AO
* 90 sec WR
* 2.5 min push @ 2%
* 1 min AO @ 2%
* 90 sec WR
* 2 min push @ 3%

* 75 sec WR
* 30 sec AO @ 6%
* 1 min WR
* 30 sec AO @ 7%
* 30 sec WR
* 30 sec AO

**Floor Block 1 - 13.5 minutes**
* 3 rounds of:
* 12 x low band low row
* 12 / 10 / 8 x bench power push up
* 200m AO row (once only - aim for between 0:30 and 1:00)
* 3 rounds of:
* 12 x low band neutral front raise
* 12 / 10 / 8 x TRX power pull up
* 200m AO row (once only)
* If finished then complete all exercises at 8 reps

**Floor Block 2 - 7.5 minutes**
* 3 rounds of:
* 12 x mid band overhead tricep extension
* 12 / 10 / 8 x mid band seated torso rotation
* 200m AO row (once only)
* If finished then complete all exercises at 8 reps",1619326815

  ##Wednesday 21 April 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Sneaky template today. I didn‚Äôt think the run was that hard but then the row.. woah! 3 x 4 minute non-stop rows. Was pretty tough. Also you have nice floor block with dead lifts, reverse lunges and some core work. 

The tread and rower are a choose your own adventure. The treads all feature inclines of between 2 and 7%. Your choice of last block is whether to go increasing or decreasing inclines. For those that follow, I did 2.1 miles excluding the warmup. I did have to go back to base as soon as we had a walking recovery. For the third block I chose block 2 as I wanted to get my heart rate up sooner. I also increased the speed as the inclines went down and ended up at a push pace for the last 90 seconds.

The row was very tough if you want to get a good distance (1200m+ was the benchmark in our class) and you have three of them! Again it is a choose your own adventure - either the stroke count row or the 150m / 100m rows.

On the floor the concept is that you practice with the first exercise, perfect with the next exercise (with weights) and then perform a power move. I didn‚Äôt find any of the moves offensive and I replaced the TRX strap with a single dumbbell for the single leg deadlift. 

Today I rated this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness - mainly for the row which I found very challenging.

  ##20 April 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Today is the squat appreciation day. Personally I didn‚Äôt find it as tough as the walking appreciation day but I guess we have just been doing a lot more squats and lunges of late. Pretty classic power template, loads of walking recoveries on offer. For those following I managed 2.2 miles in the class by running the walking recoveries. 

The row wasn‚Äôt too outrageous either so all in all a reasonable template. I give today a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. The pushes to all outs knock it down from a 4 to a 3. Not a bad one to come back to after a rest day.

  ##Monday 19 April 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Today‚Äôs early intel comes courtesy of Mrs DC as I am taking a rest day. Probably just as well as I‚Äôm not sure I wanted to take on the hills today even though I am only 5km short of my ultra. 

Looking at the tread block, the 1 minute all out at 7% is a bit rude. Like always I would only do this at an all out feeling so it shouldn‚Äôt be your all out pace. The 2 minute bases at 5% is also reasonably tough and should feel like a push.

The row blocks are all strength pulls, so low stroke rates but maximum power through the legs. If you can push hard then you should be able to get over the 150m mark on the 15 stroke rows.

Floor looks ok except for the silly bird dog low row. I would always replace that with a single arm low row with the bench and go a bit heavier on the weights.

I would give today a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. I don‚Äôt think you will get many miles on the treadmill so may be a good one to rest. I didn‚Äôt get too much FOMO today for having a rest day. Back in it tomorrow.

This is not a switch. Tough workout! 

**Floor** 

23 minutes of work:

* exercise 1, then 100m row
* exercises 1-2, then 200m row
* exercises 1-3, then 300m row
* exercises 1-4, then 400m row
* exercises 1-5, then 500m row
* it then went to just the exercises, working backwards 

Here are the exercises - the rep count is x10 total or each side depending on the movement:

* 1 - single arm chest press on the Bosu
* 2 - side to side push up
* 3 - chest press on TRX
* 4 - sprinter sit up
* 5 - plank but move single leg (?!)

**Treads**

* I don‚Äôt remember the interval times but it was two long flat road efforts, long pushes (max 2 minutes) to long base recoveries. No inclines. 
* Each block ended with a final 3x30 second push to base and a final 30 second all out. 

It was a long tough effort...

So You Think You Can Run

Floor/Rower;

So the floor/rower block stays the same. Each time you come back you have to ‚Äúbuy-in‚Äù with the push-ups and start from where you left off.

1 minute before the end of the block you complete a 30 second AO row

Walkout to Push-Up (1 push-up, reset, 2 push-ups, reset until you have completed 5)

Round 1 - complete 3 times

10x Sumo Squat to Upright Row
10x Shoulder Press

Round 2 - complete 3 times

10x Hip Bridge to Chest Fly
10x Bicycle Press (this was interesting!)

Round 3 - complete 3 times

10x Power Sit-Up with Rotation
10x Straight Leg Hip Raise

Tread;

Rather than list each and every time - basically you are adding 0.2-0.4km/h (J/R) or 0.5-1% (PW) at every time stamp. You do this 8 times.

Block 1

Starting at a base - increase with the above every 30 seconds

Block 2

Starting at a base - increase with the above every 45 seconds

Block 3 

Starting at a base - increase with the above every 1 minute

It is a switch so you complete a tread block, move to the floor, then rower, then back to the tread",1561094061

  ##Monday 6/10/19 Early Intel  
Our studio accidentally did Monday‚Äôs workout on Sunday. I was bummed to miss a power workout, but Monday‚Äôs strength was good too!

2G Strength
I started on the rower:

Block 1:
1 minute all out row just once (remember your distance)
10 lateral raises with knees on the bosu
10 reverse mountain climbers
10 (total) Spider-Man on upside down bosu

Repeat just the exercises until time. Maybe like 5-6 minute block

Block 2:
5 Deadlifts
10 alternating side lunges
5 each side weighted lunge on bosu
10 overhead extension on bosu
10 weighted crunch on bosu

Do the exercises until 2 minutes left when you have a 1 minute transition to the rowers then do 1 minute all out row to meet or beat your previous time. 14-15 minute block.

Treads (I used the strider so I will try my best here):
Block 1: 
This one is a little fuzzy, but I think it was a basic 1 minute push to 1 minute base a couple times and then the end was a 30 sec 6% base pace to a 30 sec 6% AO
WR

Block 2:
1 minute each base pace at 5, 4, 3, 2 %
1 minute AO 1%
WR

Block 3: 
30 sec base 1%
1 minute AO 1%
WR
1 minute each base pace at 5, 4, 3, 2 % 
1 minute AO 1%",1560143733

  ##2G - Tuesday 28 January 2020  
#ESP 

**Notes**

* it‚Äôs a switch at the very front of the workout only
* row-run block but row dominant 
* mini band block all at mid-band; leg dominant

**Tread**

* 4 min run for distance
* switch

**Rowers**

* 4 min row for distance
* remember your distance
* switch

You then peel off into a row-run group and a floor group as follows:

**Row-run**

* repeat your distance as above
* 160metre / 0.1 mile run
* 12 squat jumps 
* row half your distance
* 160metre / 0.1 mile run
* 12 squat jumps 
* this repeats til time called: note it is half your distance each time (so row intervals are approx 4 mins, 2 mins, 1 min, 30 secs)
* row for distance if you make the last 30 sec row, run, jumps combo 

**Floor**

_Block 1_

* three mini band exercises... which I‚Äôm forgetting the names of RN as I‚Äôm late for work üò±üòÇ but it‚Äôs along the lines of crab walk, hip raise with one leg off floor and toe reach 

_Block 2_

* alt reach on TRX (in a small studio this is a minefield....)
* lying on floor with legs raised slightly while pushing a weight above your shoulders - look I‚Äôm tired and forget the name
* elbow to knees

Enjoy! üê®",1580191263

  ##2G Monday 30 September 2019  
#2G STRENGTH

* This was not a switch
* I don‚Äôt know the 3G mods

**FLOOR**

I‚Äôll let your coach explain the rep cycles but the first exercise in each block is repeated three times in a row. 

*Block 1*

* chest press
* deadlifts [*edit* from u/sarahmg91 and u/jemesct] 
* weighted pike
* 250m row

*Block 2*

* hip hinge low row
* shoulder press to stand
* side plank crunch
* 250m row

**TREADS**

I‚Äôve likely forgotten the exact tread intervals but it was a typical strength day with inclines. Three blocks. Something like this...

* 3 min push
* 1 min base
* 2 min push - I think the first minute was at a base but with 5% incline then flat road push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push 
* base recovery 
* 1 min AO
* WR

The remaining two blocks were shorter but repeated the 5% incline at base moving to flat road push and each block ending ultimately in an AO. I can update later with feedback if helpful, but you get the gist. Run a bit, push yourself a bit, run up a hill, push yourself some more, absolutely belt it, have a walk and do it all again. 

Enjoy! üê®",1569820475

  ##Tuesday 2G 05th November  
Early intel from Dubai. (Or not so early) 

I‚Äôm trying to remember the blocks. I stared on the floor and there were 4 blocks: 

Floor block 1: 
6 rounds of jumping squats and bicep curls (reps go down for the first exercise and increase for the second) 

Floor block 2: 
6 rounds of squat jump turn thing and under cuts 

Floor block 3: 
6 rounds lunge jumps and plank lift with weights 

Floor block 4: 
6 rounds of pop squat and sprinter sit up

It‚Äôs a run row. I was on the bike so it was:

0.8 distance and 100m row 
0.8 distance and 200m row 
0.6 and 300m row 
0.4 400m row

Row is the same for treadmill but I think the distance goes from 420 to 160. 

Hope it makes sense. First time doing this :)",1572951482

#3G POWER

_EDIT_ I didn‚Äôt realise Rowvember was a specific... _thing_; our coach just said ‚Äúhappy 1st of Rowvember‚Äù when we were greeted... so I apologise if I‚Äôm letting confusion reign on the sub. There are two rowing benchmarks this month. Check the community calendar for the dates. üòÄ

* Thanks to u/superspykay for the 2G intel which I‚Äôve used for the 3G modifications. 
* This was a do-able post Hell Week workout particularly in the 3G format. I enjoyed it. 
* Is it a switch? No. 
* Partner workout? Also no. üòâ

**Treads**

Times are slightly out, my bad. There were two blocks but I‚Äôve clearly missed something in the below. 

* 90 second push
* 60 second base
* 30 second AO
* WR
* 90 second push
* 45 second base
* 30 second AO
* WR
* 90 second push
* 30 second base
* 30 second AO
* WR
* 90 second push
* 60 second base
* 30 second AO

**Rowers**

Block 1

* 250m row
* 8 squat jacks
* repeat til time called - it was just two efforts timed with block 1 for the treads 

Block 2

* 500m row
* 16 squat jacks
* 300m row
* 16 squat jacks
* 100m row
* 16 squat jacks
* hold a squat if you beat the clock

**Floor**

14 minutes 

* low bench burpee to squat jack hopping onto the bench at the end of the movement 10/8/6/4/2
* palms to elbow 8
* repeat above two exercises 5 rounds
* low bench plank jack to decline push up 4
* TRX low row _tempo_ 8
* repeat above two exercises 5 rounds 
* if you beat the clock, repeat all exercises as one block, 4 reps only
* admire the new screen format and Nike sponsorship üëü
* realise you‚Äôre running late for work because you keep updating the intel

  ##Saturday 5th September 2020 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Not a bad endurance template, shame I was still a bit sore from yesterday‚Äôs infinity template. Nice long pushes with only a couple of one minute all outs. The floor is a bit odd, a few new exercises there so save your energy for the treadmill and the rower.

The first block on the rower you are trying to get as many rounds as you can and then rowing that same distance in the second block. Furthest in our class was ~1600m.

On the floor there was a new exercise I haven‚Äôt seen before - the alternating lunge matrix. It is kind of like the woodchopper type exercise they do on the floor warmups but you are adding a lunge as well.

**Tread Block 1**
* 3 min push
* 1 min base
* 2 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push
* 1 min AO

**Tread Block 2**
* 90 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 1 min AO

**Row Block 1 - 6 minutes**
* 1 min row
* 12 x froggers
* Repeat until time - record your distance

**Row Block 2**
* 6 minutes to row your previous distance + 12 x froggers and then squat hold til time
* Rest and then time a one minute all out row with the treadmill‚Äôs last all out

**Floor Block 1 - 9 minutes**
* 15 x hip hinge swing
* 5 each x alternating lunge matrix
* 20 x plank to alternating single arm press
* 20 x reverse mountain climbers

**Floor Block 2 - 3.5 minutes**
* 15 x hip bridge
* 12 x seated torso rotation",1599282075

  ##Friday 4 September 2020 - ESP 3G 60 minutes (Infinity)  
Today was the infinity workout - one of my favorites! I did check the wiki first and today‚Äôs version does seem to be a little different. Each block is 14 minutes of hard work (provided you push yourself!). If you want that dri-tri feeling then start on the rower as it will work you through the order of the dri-tri.

If you want to know your floor split time then look at the time after you have finished two rounds. If you want to save yourself a little for the run then I suggest going hard for two rounds, having a bit of a breather and then doing the rest.

If you are feeling competitive then we had a couple of people make it through the entire row block (furthest I think was probably 2.5km all up), four rounds of the floor exercises and over 3.5km (2.19 miles) on the run.

**Tread Block - 14 minutes**
* 3 min push
* 90 sec base
* 2 min push
* 90 sec base
* 2 min push
* 90 sec base
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec AO

**Row Block - 14 minutes**
* 100m row
* 20 medicine ball power jacks
* Repeat row and decrease the reps on the power jacks
* When at 2 reps go back up again by 2 until you hit 20 reps (each time with a 100m row)
* When finished row for distance

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**
* 40 x bench hop overs
* 20 x bench tap squats
* 20 each leg x step ups
* 20 x push ups
* 20 x plank jacks
* 10 x burpees
* Repeat until time is up",1599195676

  ##Thursday 27 August 2020 - ESP (Dri Tri prep) 2G 60 minutes  
So its supposed to be dri-tri prep.. but without bench hop overs and push ups.. oh and add weights and short rows in between. Think I would have preferred infinity.. but still is a pretty challenging template, particularly on the treadmill.

I would suggest starting on the treadmill first as this is by far the hardest part of the template given the long pushes to all outs. The floor is all with weights (except the toe taps) and the short power rows will give you some splats depending on how hard you go.

  ##Tuesday 25 August 2020 - Strength (Run Row) 2G 60 minutes  
Love my run rows - if you can find a 2G to do this one then try to as this is a doozy! Pushes up hills with very little rest means you may already be a bit knackered when you get to the run row. Most people got to the bonus round, furthest in class was around the 600m mark (in the run for distance).

The floor block has some nice drop sets with the close grip chest press and the low rows. No legs which is great so there is no penalties if you decide to go on the floor first and then do the treadmills.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min push
* 45 sec base
* 1 min push @ 3%
* 45 sec base
* 1 min push @ 5%
* 90 sec base (straight into run row)

**Tread Block 2 - 10.5 minutes**
* 160m (0.1 miles) @ 5%

* 200m row
* 160m 
* 200m row
* 160m @ 3%
* 200m row
* 160m @ 5%
* 200m row
* Reset monitor and run for distance for remaining time

**Tread Block 3**
* 1 min push @ 5%
* 45 sec base
* 1 min push @ 3%
* 45 sec base
* 1 min AO

**Floor Block 1 - 7 minutes**

  ##Monday 24 August 2020 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
This is a good template to test yourself. All of the treadmill block is run for distances so if you aren‚Äôt feeling like pushing it you can always dial it back. The coach will ask you if you match or beat your previous distances so I would suggest that you start off a little bit off your push pace and then increasing as you go through the blocks. I treated the last 2 minute block as an all out.

**Tread Block 1**
* 8 min run for distance (record your distance)
* 90 sec WR
* 4 min run for distance (try to match or beat half of your previous distance)

**Tread Block 2**
* 4 min run for distance (try to match or beat your previous distance)
* 90 sec WR
* 2 min run for distance (try to match or beat half of your previous distance)

**Floor Block 1 - 13.5 minutes**
* Exercise 1: 10 x burpees
* Exercise 2: 20 x bench hop overs
* Exercise 3: 40 x running man
* Exercise 4: 10 x seated hammer curls
* Exercise 5: 10 x TRX tricep extension
* Round 1: Exercises 1, 4 and 5
* Round 2: Exercises 2, 4 and 5
* Round 3: Exercises 3, 4 and 5
* 800m row
* If finished repeat exercises as a single block

**Floor Block 2 - 7.5 minutes**
* 10 x TRX bicep curl
* 15 x seated overhead tricep extension
* 20 x static crunch alternating heel touch",1598245272

  ##Friday 21 August 2020 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
After the last couple of days this almost feels like a rest day. Pretty much core work on the floor with a couple of all out rows. The hills are pretty brutal but are thankfully not that long and you can always lower your speed on the hills + all outs.

  ##Saturday 3 October 2020 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Nice template today focusing on endurance power rows and some long pushes on the treadmill. My suggestion is to start just above your base and add a bit more each minute. The floor block is long, focusing on bench work with the TRX straps.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min push
* 30 sec base
* 90 sec push 
* 45 sec base
* 2 min push
* 1 min base
* 45 sec AO

**Tread Block 2**
* 4 min progressive push (each minute add 0.5 to 1 kmh)
* 1 min AO

**Row Block 1 - 7.5 minutes**
* 300m row + 10 reverse lunges
* Each round take off 50m until you get to 100m
* Row for distance

**Row Block 2**
* 4 min progressive push row - start at 24 strokes per minute and add 1 stroke per minute each minute
* 1 min AO row

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**
* 2 rounds of:
* 10 each bench step down to toe tap
* 20 x lateral bench hop over
* 10 x bench sit up to stand with a dumbbell
* 20 x decline mountain climber
* 2 rounds of:
* 15 x TRX bridge row
* 15 x TRX high row
* If finished then do all exercises as a single block",1601701279

  ##Friday 2 October 2020 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Nice ESP session today, if you are looking to do some heavier weights then today is the day to go to the big rack for your chest press, low row and shoulder press. They have paired up the strength moves with some nice power sets (e.g. power push ups).

The treadmill is a nice endurance block with a 3 minute push to test the lungs. Same with the rower - furthest in the row for distance at the end was over 500m in our session (but you can do that easily if you don't go hard in the first block!).

**Tread Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 3 min push
* 1 min base
* 90 sec push
* 30 sec base
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 2 - 6 minutes**

* 2 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min AO

**Row Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 100m row + 12 squat jacks
* Repeat, adding 100m row each round
* Record your distance

**Row Block 2 - 6 minutes**

* Row your previous distance and then reset your monitor
* 12 squat jacks
* Row for distance (record your distance)

**Floor Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**

* 5 x chest press
* 10 x power push up
* 5 x hip hinge low row
* 10 x hip hinge reverse fly (explosive tempo)

**Floor Block 2 - 6 minutes**

* 5 x lateral step up with dumbell (L)
* 5 x lateral step up with power (L)
* Do all on the left leg first and then on the right

  ##Sunday 27 September 2020 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Congratulations on all the dri-tri competitors this weekend. I completed my mini hell-weekend (catch me if you can, dri-tri and a Sunday workout) this morning. Didn‚Äôt do a PB on the dri-tri but wasn‚Äôt aiming for one given I tore my hamstring a month ago (not at OTF!!).

Today is a nice power template. My advice would be to try and hold base in between the all outs if you want to try and get as many splats as you can. You have approx 1 minute of walking recovery in between the first three blocks.

The row block can be challenging if you are trying to beat your row for distance each round. You could probably up your weights on the floor block if the low rows and neutral half thrusters are not that challenging.

  ##Sunday 20 September 2020 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
Long tread blocks today, all pushes are 90 seconds with varying degrees of base recovery in between. Only short all outs but expect some long tread time if you are doing the 2G. The floor is pretty easy with a short row to get your heart pumping but everything else is pretty light work with the bosu.

With the front squats, the stick it just meant to pause at the bottom and then thrust up to complete the motion. We added push ups to the burpee with the bosu but its up to your studio.

**Tread Block 1**
* 90 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 60 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 60 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 60 sec push
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 2**
* 90 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 60 sec base
* 90 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 30 sec AO

**Floor Block 1 - 14 minutes**
* 3 rounds of rowing: 600m row + 10 jump squats, each round decrease the row by 200m
* 8 each side x single dumb bell static lunge on the bosu
* 16 x alternating pop squat
* 8 each side x bosu side plank hip dip

**Floor Block 2 - 7.5 minutes**
* 8 x front squat (stick it)
* 8 x bosu burpee
* 12 x bosu reverse hyper extension 
* 12 x bosu plank alternating leg lift",1600578081

  ##Thursday 18 June 2020 - Strength 2G  
Today was a strength template, but mixed with the pushes it did feel more like an ESP. For me it was also the return of the mini bands (so the glutes will be sore tomorrow) and single leg bench squats.

  ##Tuesday 16 June 2020 - ESP 2G  
Today was an ESP but the tread block felt like an endurance session. Our coach started all of the floor blocks with a 2 minute core workout but not sure if that was really part of the template.

  ##Friday 10 July 2020 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Today is the trial run for the 12 minute benchmark. Nice one to see how far you can push yourself in 5 and a half minutes. My suggestion for the run is to start at your push pace (or slightly above) and just keep creeping the speed up in small increments, last 30-60 seconds try and do an all out. Floor is all about core with a bit of weights.

**Tread Block - 12.5 minutes**
* 5.5 minutes run for distance (record your distance)
* 90 sec WR
* 5.5 minutes run for distance (try to beat your previous distance)

**Row Block - 12.5 minutes**
* 90 second row for distance
* 10 squat to press with rotation
* Row your 90 second distance less 50m and do the 10 squat to press with rotation
* Keep up the row and squat press combinations but reduce the distance by 50m each time
* When down to 100m finish (and do the 10 squat to press) and then row for distance

**Floor Block - 12.5 minutes**
* 10 each side - side plank hip dip
* 10 x toe reach
* Repeat above three times
* 5 each side suitcase squat
* 10 x plank pull through
* 5 each hollow hold single arm close chest press
* 5 each balance bicep curl
* Repeat until time",1594357247

  ##Thursday 9 July 2020 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
A break from endurance blocks! Nice little power template today.. rowing blocks are not that hard and you will probably need to add a little bit so you don‚Äôt have to do a squat hold for eternity.. The floor block is a little repetitive, I would add some core + weighted exercises to balance it out.

**Tread Block - 14 minutes**
* 90 sec push
* 30 sec base
* 30 sec AO
* 60 sec WR
* 90 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 30 sec AO
* 75 sec WR
* 90 sec push
* 60 sec base
* 30 sec AO
* 60 WR
* 60 push
* 60 base
* 30 sec AO

**Row Block 1 - 2.5 minutes**
* 250m row
* 12 reverse lunges
* 250m row
* squat hold til time

**Row Block 2 - 7 minutes**
* 500m row
* 20 reverse lunges
* 350m row
* 16 reverse lunges
* 150m row
* 12 reverse lunges
* squat hold (I think this one needed an extra row block as we ended up doing a squat hold for over 2 minutes!)

**Row Block 3 - 2.5 minutes**
* 250m row
* 12 reverse lunges
* 250m row
* squat hold til time

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**
* 10/8/6 x low bench burpee to squat jack
* 8 x palm to elbows
* Repeat for three sets
* 8 x goblet squats
* 8 each leg x low bench reverse lunge to hop

  ##Wednesday 8 July 2020 - Strength (Endurance) 3G 60 minutes  
Today is a strength template but it felt more like an endurance given the runs for distance and the long rows. Each tread and row block you are trying to beat your previous distance.. obviously very hard on the last blocks.

* 320m run (0.2 miles)
* 30 sec WR

* 100m row
* 20 pulsing half squats
* 150m row
* 20 pulsing half squats
* 200m row
* 20 pulsing half squats
* 250m row
* 20 pulsing half squats

  ##Tuesday 8 June 2021 - ESP ‚Äú1 mile benchmark‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
Benchmark day! One of the hardest benchmarks in my mind. Just short enough to be called a power workout but long enough to burn the lungs and test the legs. 

My advice for the benchmark is to just set the treadmill at an aggressive push and break the benchmark down into quarters. At the 400m mark if you are not feeling that bad then start to up the pace progressively. Generally I feel reasonable for the first four minutes but then the last minute or so is just all burn and the legs start to give out.

On the rower it is all endurance row challenges with reverse lunges and the floor is some power moves with upper body weights. I wouldn‚Äôt take these too seriously if you are looking to get a good time on the treadmill.

For this template I give it a 2 (ü™∂ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Sunday 6 June 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
For the 2G today we have a run/row focusing on incline distance goals and stroke rate on the rower. I didn‚Äôt find it particularly tough (given yesterday) but there is opportunities for splats on the tread and rower. 

For the tread / row portion, the first block is timed with pushes on the treadmill and timed rows. Second block you are by yourself with repeating sets of 400m (0.25 mile) runs and 400m rows. I didn‚Äôt find the second block too hard and told the coach that instead of repeating the 400m runs they could have added a run for distance with inclines at the end. This way you could have had ~3 minutes of inclines to cap off the running. The rowing all has a stroke rate goal but if you want I think you can just ignore it and go hell for leather. 

The floor block also felt a bit long and I think the could have added in another exercise to these long blocks. Thankfully there is no squats and it is all upper body / core focused. For the rollout, if the TRX doesn‚Äôt give you the burn in your abs, switch it out for the ab dolly.
 
I found today pretty easy but am mindful that I am a freak that likes inclines. I give today a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness, there is loads of times to recover and even the run/row wasn‚Äôt too bad.

  ##Saturday 5 June 2021 - Endurance ‚ÄúNon Stop‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
This is one of my favourite OTF workouts - the Non Stop! 14 minutes on the tread, rower and non-stop action on the floor. It is pretty challenging but you do feel like you have accomplished something by the end of it. I am also sorry to say that you will be doing yet more squats on the floor which is even harder after this week‚Äôs squat-a-thon! I think all sessions will be run as a 3G today, we only had enough to make up a 1G and we still did three stations.

Treadmill and rower are the same. Long push effort followed by half the time in base recovery. There is a short little all out at the end. Furthest distance on the tread in our group was 3.774km and furthest on the rower was 4km even. My advice is that you should try to increase your push as the times get shorter and don‚Äôt go too low on the base recovery, try and keep those distances ticking over even on the recovery efforts. 

On the floor you do two non-stop sets back to back. First set is all weighted - squats, deadlifts, rows, uppercuts and curls. Second set focuses on the core. If you do it properly you should be getting close to orange on the first set as you rip through the exercises. Choose a weight that is challenging to do the bicep curl and then use it for all the exercises.

I quite enjoyed this but it is hard - I give this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Friday 4 June 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
OTF love their inclines and squats this month. Plenty of them today. 

On the tread, thankfully we only have 30 second all outs. But only one of them is on the flat road. The rest are on increasing inclines. On the plus side there are heaps of walking recoveries. I kept the same all out pace for the inclines and walked the recoveries. However, you could probably get back to base earlier if you want some extra splats.

On the floor there are some long rows and yet more squats and variants of squats. Heaps and heaps of reps as well so you should get some splats on the floor if you go hard on the row and some of the power moves.

I didn‚Äôt think today was as bad as yesterday (90 second all outs?!?!?) but the all outs at inclines will be challenging if you want to try and maintain your all out pace. Today is a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 3 June 2021 - Power ‚Äú3x3‚Äù 2G/3G 60 minutes  
Coach told us that all sessions today will be run as a 3G so there is no 2G template. Essentially it is centered around 3 blocks of work with a short effort at the end. 

On the treadmill it is all the same. Short push, base and then a 90 second run for distance (read: all out). You get a decent walking recovery in between but if you have been treating this as an aggressive push to all out you will need all of that time. The last run for distance comes off a 90 second walking recovery so the theory goes that you should be able to up your pace.

Rowers follow the treads but in the one minute base you get pulsing squat restercises. Our coach was calling out the furthest distances on the 90 second rounds and someone did get 610 metres (I was a bit dubious as that is a ridiculous distance to get in 90 seconds). My furthest was 532m and it just got worse from there.. especially as you have the all outs to start with and then the squats in the middle. 

On the floor, you should get splats as well. Half thrusters, squats, jump squats, power pull ups!! The last round is an iso hold either push up or plank. A couple of us managed the full 90 seconds for the iso push up hold.

All in all this was pretty tough. I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. 90 second all outs will burn your legs and lungs!

  ##Wednesday 2 June 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Tasty little endurance block today - one of my favorites, just long blocks with very little rest. Mrs DC is doing the 2G run/row so will have some intel on that a little later.

Only 3.5 minutes of base pace today. Rest is all push with a little all out at the end. Good day to see how you are progressing with new push pace or surprise yourself by upping it a little.

On the rower it is a pretty long block with distance goals and some restercise (forward and back hops). Furthest distance (in the row for distance at the end) was 1250m.

On the floor it has some different moves. We substituted the squat to upward rotation with single arm full thrusters and the transverse goblet squat to normal goblet squats. The Y-squat essentially is holding your arms up in a Y-pose and then doing a bench tap squat. You can also just put your arms behind your head (like a prisoner squat).

Good day, I enjoyed it but was still challenging. I give this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Tuesday 1 June 2021 - ES(p) ‚ÄúStrong and Stable‚Äù 3G 60 minutes  
I was supposed to have a rest day yesterday but I had major FOMO after seeing the early 2G intel. So no rest for me and a record 40 splats for the session! Today is a little easier but not too much with plenty of hills and stability work on offer.

The tread is all base pace with incline featuring a short all out at the end. The row is all 15 stroke rows with balance work in between.

The floor all starts with a weighted exercises followed by a longer set featuring the same muscle groups and then core work to finish.

Today‚Äôs workout I gave a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Monday May 31 2G - ESP  
Good morning! I did a 45min but saw the run/row info for the 60min so have put it below. (45min halved all the rowing). This is the 45min floor but I‚Äôm guessing the 60min is the same or very similar anyway :)

Run/row:


2.4km run

2000m row


OR


1.2km run

1000m row 

X2


OR 


0.48km run 

400m row 

X5

If done:

I think it was 0.48km run @3% / 400m row a few more times and then run for distance? I definitely didn‚Äôt get that far lol

Floor:

All exercises x5/10/15/20 (increase each round)

- squat 
- trx bridge row 
- bench step ups (each)
- push ups 
- plank jacks 
- sit ups 

BUT 

Every 4 minutes, stop whatever you‚Äôre doing and do 10 full burpees


Enjoy :)",1622437233

  ##Saturday 29 May 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
In retrospect, a rest day should have been warranted given mayhem. My heart sank when the coach told us it was a strength day and we had plenty of inclines to follow. He should have also told us that it was pretty much a strength + endurance day.. oh well.

The tread blocks are pretty simple. 3 one minute pushes at inclines for the first two blocks with a one minute all out at the end. Normally I don‚Äôt struggle with the inclines, but after yesterdays effort and all the inclines during the week I did find this quite hard.

The floor isn‚Äôt too bad, with the only a couple of weird new exercises being the hammer to eccentric bicep curl and the plank to thread the needle. We also didn‚Äôt do the single arm deadlifts and just did normal deadlifts at 12 reps. Hardly any rowing in the 2G which was nice.

For today‚Äôs template I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 mainly because of the brutal tread block. Maybe I am just a bit worn out after mayhem but it did feel pretty difficult.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min push @ 2%
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 3%
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 4%
* 1 min base
* 1 min AO @ 5%

**Tread Block 2**
* 1 min push @ 5%
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 4%
* 1 min base

* 1 min AO @ 2%

**Tread Block 3**
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push
* 1 min AO

**Floor Block 1 - 7 minutes**
* 6 each x bench single arm low row

* 6 each x forearm plank thread the needle

**Floor Block 2 - 7 minutes**
* 6 each x neutral grip shoulder press
* 6 each x single arm deadlift
* 12 total x alt. Superman

**Floor Block 3 - 6 minutes**

  ##28 May 2021 - Mayhem 6 ‚ÄúHard core floor‚Äù 2G 60 minutes  
Hooray - last mayhem and its a good one! All I can say is that the run/row block is the easiest part of this workout. No inclines, just nice long runs with 600m rows (a few restercises to break it up). However.. the template designers seem to have forgotten we did upper body work earlier this week (remember upper body uproar) and they have created a hellish template for your triceps, shoulders and biceps.

First off - the run/row. Run 960m and then do a variation of a 600m row. Three times. Then run for distance. Pretty simple. Tactic for this one is to do your push pace on the run and use the rower to catch your breath a little bit. Not too much, otherwise you are doing too many of the power jacks or front raises. Furthest distance in my class (on the run for distance) was just shy of 1km. Mind you only 5 people got to the distance run so it isn‚Äôt that easy (out of a class of 14).

The floor is the hell part. Each round has a 2 minutes of planks to bookend the weights work. All of it is timed so there is no escaping doing a truckload of exercises (unless you are really slow). My arms and shoulders are still burning. Expect to feel this tomorrow and maybe the next day. I recommend massage, icing and anti-inflammatory creams after this one. I know the timing doesn‚Äôt quite add up but that is what they had on the board. Essentially you have 1 minute plank, 30 seconds to get your weights and then into 30 second rounds with 15 seconds to recovery between sets. Then another plank at the end for good measure (1 minute).

All in all this is still a 1 (ü™∂) out 5 for gentleness. It is up there with yesterday in terms of difficulty. Still think Sunday was the hardest closely followed by today and yesterday. But hey.. at least there are no inclines and you get a sweet hat out of it.

  ##Sunday 20 June 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
According to the intel calendar this is the Father‚Äôs Day workout so happy Father‚Äôs Day to all you Dads out there. Today has quite a few switches so you will have to increase intensity in order to get your splats in.

You will have three tread blocks broken up by two rowing blocks. First and last tread blocks are a straight three minute run for distance. Middle block is a power focused block with 30 second all outs. The run for distances are pretty self explanatory but I think in order to get splats on the power section you should try to increase your all out efforts each time. The rower is all the same and will give you a nice opportunity to test different intensity across base, push and all out.

On the floor we have the Beyonc√© move up front followed by loads of squats and core work. When it is paired with the rowing blocks it is all timed starting with tempo moves and increasing intensity. The walk out combo at the end is a walkout push up to plank jack to pop jack and walking back to a standing position.

I didn‚Äôt think today was too bad but found that all the switching meant that I didn‚Äôt get a lot of splats. However, some of the moves on the floor are a little tricky . I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Mrs DC is doing the 3G so will see what that looks like.

  ##Sunday 20 June 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Thanks to Mrs DC we have the 3G template. Looks a bit harder with 2 x 4 minute run for distances! Surprising to see more running in the 3G, I guess if you want some longer tread blocks then I would go for the 3G over the 2G. Mrs DC said that this is pretty hard so I would give this one a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Saturday 19 June 2021 - Power 2G 60 minutes  
Nice power session today and nice to see bosu‚Äôs back again. The template designers must seen all the calls for bosu‚Äôs to come back and here they are for my Saturday workout. 

On the tread, the max all out you will do is 30 seconds and there is heaps of walking recovery between blocks so feel free to increase your push and all out efforts. The second block is probably the hardest with the push to all out efforts but I think you should be able to stick it out. My modification was to keep upping the inclines as you do the all outs (or increasing the all out speed) and getting back to base on the longer walking recoveries. The last block was supposed to be 3 minutes but I think that our coach added a little extra all out on the end!

On the floor we have some power rows and loads of burpee and bosu variants. I found the floor a bit harder than normal, particularly the ultimate burpees with the neutral full thrusters and the bosu v-ups. Expect to get some splats on the floor today as well. Coach asked us to add 2 reps to all the exercises each round but I think it is only on the last exercise per the screen.

If the floor was a little more gentle then I would have given this a 3 but the burpees and bosu action tip it over to a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 17 June 2021 - 500m benchmark row 3G 60 minutes  
Another benchmark and somehow this seems like it is the easiest template this week. Main focus is on the row of course so the other blocks are designed to be non-threatening.

The first block is 4 minutes long and everyone gets to switch around so that they are relatively fresh for the benchmark. The other blocks are easier than what we have had for the rest of the week. Only ones I wasn‚Äôt a fan of was the step down to hammer curls and plank pull throughs.

For the row, there are heaps of tips on how to do this. I try to start off with longer, more powerful strokes to start with to get the water moving and about half way in switch to shorter all out rows. Mind you I didn‚Äôt get a PB this time, maybe all the hell week templates this week had me a bit more tired than usual but wasn‚Äôt feeling it this time round. Good luck!

For this template, I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Wednesday 16 June 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Well yesterday was pretty rough and I thought that OTF template designers may have thought to take pity on us. I should have known better. This is a pretty tough template as well featuring 4 (!!!) 2 minute run and row for distances. Incline work, squats, lunges and plenty of restercise! Just on yesterday, probably the funniest comment I saw was from one of Mrs DC‚Äôs friends who cussed out the trainer with ‚Äú3 weeks off. F\*ck you *trainer name* with your continuous hammer curls and jump squats üò°Assume the position mother f\*cker‚Äù - I take it she did not enjoy the template with the 18 all outs and timed floor exercises. I am sure it comes from a place of love haha

Anyway, on the treadmill your incline work is book ended with 2 x 2 minute run for distances. The coach will try to get you to beat your distance in the second round so you can either increase your paces in the second round or maybe take it a little easy for the first one - your choice! The incline work is all at base pace but does feature a short all out at the end. There is plenty of walking recovery in between blocks so you should be able to get your breath back. Edit: Furthest distance I saw in class for the 2 min run was 640m + (0.4 miles).

On the rower it is similar with the 2 minute efforts. For your 7 minute block in the middle you are doing a pyramid of all out efforts on the rower with squat jacks as your restercise.

On the floor it is all lower body apart from decline pushups and a short little 2 minute block of burpees. The last 2 minutes of the floor is a static hold or perhaps just collapsing on the floor.

For today‚Äôs template I give it another 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness mainly for the 2 minute all out efforts + burpees. 

**Tread Block 1**
* 2 min run for distance, record your distance

**Tread Block 2**
* 45 sec base @ 4%
* 30 sec base @ 1%
* 45 sec base @ 5%
* 30 sec base @ 1%
* 45 sec base @ 6%
* 30 sec base @ 1%
* 45 sec base @ 5%
* 30 sec base @ 1%
* 45 sec base @ 4%
* 30 sec base @ 1%
* 45 sec AO @ 1%

**Tread Block 3**
* 2 min run for distance, try to beat your distance from block 1

**Row Block 1**
* 2 min row for distance, record your distance

**Row Block 2 - 7 minutes**
* 100m row + 16 x squat jacks
* 200m row + 18 x squat jacks
* 300m row + 20 x squat jacks
* 200m row + 18 x squat jacks
* 100m row + 16 x squat jacks
* Row for distance until time

**Row Block 3**
* 2 min row for distance, try to beat your distance from block 1

**Floor Block 1 - 2 minutes**
* Low bench full burpee to squat jack

**Floor Block 2 - 7 minutes**
* 5 x clean to front squat
* 5 each x low bench reverse lunge to hop
* 10 x decline push up
* 10 x TRX bridge row

**Floor Block 3 - 2 minutes**
* hollow hold
* static crunch hold
* Hold as long as possible, when done alternate and repeat",1623819632

  ##Tuesday 15 June 2021 - Power 2G/3G 60 minutes  
Apparently all the templates are the same today, so this will be the same for the 2G class. You are in for a treat today as this template is super tough! There is hardly any transition time so you will maximize your time in the studio today.

On the treads, rowers and floor you have one minute all outs / exercises. At least with the treads you get a 45 second walking recovery but not so lucky on the rowers and floor where you have a restercise! My advice on the treads is to take all the walking recovery you can get - no modifications here as you will definitely get splats all across the studio.

The coach was calling out distances on the rower. Furthest for the guys was 3.5km and for the ladies it was 3.24km.

On the floor there is plenty of upper and lower body work. After the rower and the treadmill my body was saying no more to the squat jumps and the shoulder work but there is no respite!

This is definitely a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Monday 14 June 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Quite enjoyed the class today. It features a pretty challenging run/row to start on the treads/rower and then some nice lower body strength and stability moves on the floor. 

On the treadmill you are progressively increasing your incline whilst decreasing the distance run / rowed. The max incline that I saw anyone get into in the class is 14%. My suggestion is to treat the first block as an aggressive push to all out and then decrease the speeds as the inclines get higher. I probably didn‚Äôt go hard enough on the first block and only got to 13% by the end, if I did it again I would max out the first couple of 320m runs and then decrease the speed after that. The rule on our studio was that if you were mid run at a certain incline, that is what you started on next time around, even if you had completed more than 50% of the distance.

On the floor we have heaps of squats and deadlifts. Only one set of lunges which was good and even the core work wasn‚Äôt too bad. No ab dolly or mini bands here!

Nice challenging workout today, I would give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness given the amount of running you have to do. 

**Tread/Row Block 1 - 7 minutes**
* 320m (0.2 mile) run
* 200m row
* Repeat until time, adding 1% to incline each round

**Tread/Row Block 2 - 6.5 minutes**
* Pick up incline where you left off
* 240m (0.15 mile) run
* 150m row 
* Repeat until time, adding 1% to incline each round

**Tread/Row Block 3 - 6.5 minutes**
* Pick up incline where you left off
* 160m (0.1 mile) run
* 100m row 
* Repeat until time, adding 1% to incline each round

**Floor Block 1 - 7 minutes**
* 10 / 8 / 6 x dead lift
* 6 each x bench static lunge
* 6 each x lateral step up

**Floor Block 2 - 6.5 minutes**
* 10 / 8 / 6 x sumo squat
* 8 x iso bridge tricep extension
* 8 x iso bridge chest fly

**Floor Block 3 - 6.5 minutes**
* 6 each x single leg dead lift
* 6 each x goblet transverse squat
* 16 x plank alt leg lift",1623646829

  ##Friday 11 June 2021 - Power 2G 60 minutes  
Nice little power session to start off the long weekend here in Sydney. As soon as I heard it was just 30 second all outs I had a mental fist pump but this was moderated with the fact that this was going to be on the treadmill and rower. In fact you only have 9 minutes total on the floor!

On the treadmill, you have a two book end blocks that features pushes and a short all out. The main block is in the middle where you should be aiming to max out your all out speeds given the amount of walking recovery you have on offer. My DC modification is to increase the incline by 1% for each all out (getting you to 9% by the end of the treadmill section) and to get back to base for the walking recoveries. Regardless, you should be able to get close to a PB on the second last all out as you have a 2 minute walking recovery before it.

The floor is mostly on the rower, matching the treads. You have some power moves in the first and third block but most of the focus will be on the rower. On the clean to press we were coached to use a weight greater than you can shoulder press so you are forced to use your legs to shoot the weights up overhead. I quite liked the floor exercises and they worked to keep the heart rate up.

All in all, I thought this was pretty doable and I give this a 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 10 June 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Hope everyone recovered after yesterday‚Äôs endurance session. Be interested to know if anyone else who did the mile benchmark and backed up also felt it was pretty tough. Anyway, today is a strength session. I found this a lot easier than yesterday but good fun nonetheless.

On the treads it is a pretty standard push / base combo with inclines for the first block and then an incline challenge for the next. Essentially you do 160m (0.1 mile) push and base runs and increase the incline by 1% each time you do a push. Max incline that anyone got to in my class was 8% which is pretty crazy. Our coach added a 30 sec AO at your highest incline to finish the second block.

The row has a stroke rate count for the first block. Second block you are doing a 200m distance challenge, trying to beat your distance from previous block all the while reducing your stroke rate.

On the floor it is all upper body exercises using the bench at an incline for the first block and then switching to rows for the second block. Good day to up your weights - 5 reps on the main exercise is not much.

All in all I didn‚Äôt think this was too bad. I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 2%
* 1 min base
* 1 min push @ 3%
* 1 min base
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* 160m (0.1 mile) push @ 1%
* 160m (0.1 mile) base @ 1%
* Repeat, adding 1% to the push effort each time

**Row Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**
* 15 stroke row + 8 each x medicine ball wood chopper 
* Record your distance

**Row Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* 200m row (count strokes) + 10 x medicine ball good morning
* Repeat, taking 1 off the strokes required to get to 200m
* Try to beat your distance from block 1

**Floor Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**
* 5 x incline close grip chest press
* 10 x incline bicep curl
* 20 total x static crunch with scissors

**Floor Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* 5 each x split stance single arm low row
* 10 x overhead tricep extension
* 20 total x bicycle",1623301237

  ##Wednesday Aug 25th Power 2G  
Nice solid power day with a twist, that is zero rowing.  There are lots of one minute all outs on the tread with plenty of pre-base or walking so you get a good chance to up your speed.  The floor is quite challenging with some decent weights cardio.  Seems like you'll be needing lots of different weights and will be frequently moving mats and benches around.  So if possible try to get plenty of space for your station today.  I give this a 3/5 for easyness

- 1 min push
- 90 sec base
- 1 min all out with 1 min WR
- Repeat 

Tread block 2:  3.5 min

- 1 min push
- 90 sec base
- 1 min all out

Tread block 3:  8 min

- 1 min all out with 1 min WR  repeat 4 times

Floor block 1:  8 min

- Bench situp to jump squat 5 reps
- Deadlifts 10 reps
- Bench lateral hopovers 10 reps
- Lateral lunges 10 reps

Floor block 2:  3.5 min

  ##Wednesday July 28th 2G 60min Power  
A reasonably different power day. 8x 4.5min blocks, all the all outs were 45seconds, so still able to get some distance in on the treads. Floor blocks each start with a 200m row and has two exercises. I'm not sure how gentle it really was, so will hedge my bets and just give it ü™∂ü™∂ü™∂
(For those asking, the bear hops are where you hold a bear hold [hands under shoulders, knees under hips but off the floor], then you 'hop' both feet up vertically and land in the same place)

  ##Thursday 09/07/2021 2G Power  
**EDIT: I mean Friday!!**

Greetings from Canberra! I did the 2G Power today and it was a super fun block. The theme is 'Load and Explode' so the floor block has a pattern of a weighted 'load' exercise followed by a body weight power 'explode' exercise. However it does end with about 5 straight mins of core work which means it'll hurt to laugh today.

* 90s WR
* 2 min push

Okay all, today was tough ü•µ‚ò†Ô∏è
My sincere apologies for a lack of formatting and if some of the timings are a bit off - it was a hard one to remember all the finite detail! Coach suggested it was a ‚ÄòHell Week taster‚Äô - can strongly recommend a different type of ‚Äòtaster‚Äô i.e. a wine tasting or a gin tasting. All exercises are timed, rather than any distance or rep counts. The floor was very tough with the 1 minute burpees in the middle there!

  ##Sunday 3rd October - Strength 3G  
Hey all. A strength template today. Coach instructed to use heavy weights on the floor as it‚Äôs a more controlled day with only two exercises per block. All of these blocks are to be repeated until time. The tready block seemed okay until Block 3, which really crept up ü•µ. The main goal here is to hold base pace despite the increasing inclines. Fairly straightforward rower block but could sense anyone who did the ‚Äònon-stop‚Äô yesterday was a bit over the row! Have a great day, cheers.

Strength day with a little rowing and only small inclines is good. My coach challenged me to beat 1500m in the 5 min block. The floor is good to go heavy on the first exercise of each block, but the second exercise you'll need to drop down the weights significantly.

- 1 min push
- 1 min base
- 1 min all out

Tread block 1,  7.5 mins

- 90s incline push @ 4%
- 1 min base
- 90s incline push @ 4%
- 1 min base
- 90s push
- 1 min all out

Tread block 2, 7.5 mins

- same as block 1, but inclines are at 3%


Floor block 1, 5 mins

- 10 X mid band hip bridge
- 10 X mid band knee tucks
- 10 X mid band static crunch in and outs

Floor block 2, 7.5 mins

Please take a look at [the weight-loss guide on our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/wiki/weight-loss). It covers a lot of the basics and has specific sections about specific diets and programs commonly used by OTF members. Since everybody and every body is different, we recommend that you also discuss your weight-loss goals and challenges with a registered dietitian or another professional, especially if you are not seeing the results you are expecting.

  ##Thursday 2nd September, 2G 60min Power  
Pretty simple power day, short blocks, 30s all outs, but only 36mins of work... 

Edited to add: at the end of each block there is a 90s walking recovery/ transition. The transition time after block 4 and block 8 is probably a little longer to allow you to wipe down equipment etc. So Transitions in total are about 13 minutes (6 X 90s + 2 X 2min). You also have a 5 min warm up and a 3 minute stretch and a 1 min lobby intro. All in it adds up to 58 minutes (36 + 13 + 5 + 3 + 1).

  ##Thursday 21 October 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
I really questioned why the OTF gods decided to put this template the day before CMIYC. Supposedly an ESP but to be honest it is all endurance with a little bit of power. 

The tread block is a brute today, particularly the second block. 3 minute push? Only a 45 second base? 90 second run for distance (all out)? No hiding today. If you want to save yourself for CMIYC I would ease off a little if you are doing this class. I kept my normal speeds and was in red for pretty much the whole second block. If you are interested in collecting the miles this one is good. Definitely over 3 miles on the tread. 

The floor is very forgettable and I didn‚Äôt really like it. Lots of bosu work. A little bit of rowing. Meh.

For today‚Äôs template I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Particularly nasty ahead of CMIYC.

**Tread Block 1**
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec AO
* 1 min WR
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec AO
* 1 min WR
* 45 sec push
* 30 sec AO
* 75 sec WR
* 45 sec push
* 30 sec AO
* 75 sec WR
* 30 sec AO

**Tread Block 2**
* 3 min push
* 45 sec base
* 2.5 min push
* 45 sec base
* 2 min push
* 45 sec base
* 1.5 min run for distance

**Floor Block 1 - 10.5 minutes**
* 400m push row (record time) once only
* 2 rounds of:
* 8 x hip hinge swing
* 12 total x bosu plank alternating leg lift
* 2 rounds of:
* 8 x front squat (explosive tempo)
* 12 total x bosu plank spiderman 

**Floor Block 2 - 11.25 minutes**
* 400m push row (try to beat time from first block) once only
* Repeat the following:
* 8 each side x bosu goblet static lunge
* 12 total x bosu bicycles
* 12 x bosu superman",1634792438

  ##20 October 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Two power days in a row! Teaches me for not reading the intel calendar before heading into the class. It‚Äôs a pretty good one today, quite enjoyed it. No funky moves. Not too much core work after yesterday. Only a single 1 minute all out.

On the tread it follows the same pattern each time, the only thing that changes is the walking recovery (gets longer yay!) and the all out (gets shorter, another yay!). My suggestion is to either up the push or the base to get your heart rate up as they did feel a little short. 

On the rower, you have heaps of ground to presses with the medicine ball and a distance goal for the first and last blocks. The middle block is timed with the treadmills.

On the floor it is weighted exercises paired with a core move but I didn‚Äôt find it too excessive. No splats on the floor this time. I went a bit heavier for the weights as you only have a few reps there but you sacrifice the number of sets you can push out.

I didn‚Äôt find today‚Äôs template too obnoxious and so gave it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. It would have been a 4 except for the ground to presses and the one minute all out. Am considering a rest day tomorrow ahead of CMIYC but will see how the body feels after stretching and foam rolling.

  ##Tuesday 19 October 2021 - Hell Week Throw Back #2 (power) 3G 60 minutes  
I didn‚Äôt find this one nearly as bad as last week‚Äôs hell week throw back and was quite enjoyable (not having a million snatches and the 4 minute run for distance is a huge relief). It is still very difficult but felt a bit more doable.

On the treads you just have walking recoveries and all outs. They are timed such that you should just get back to green after the all outs but barely. First block is all 45 second all outs (with a sneaky 30 second all out at the end) and the second block is 1 minute all outs. Not much finesse in the treadmill section.

On the rower, the first block is timed with the treads and the second features 30 second all outs with lunges.

On the floor it is never ending core exercises. You may suffer from ab cramping afterwards. My suggestion is to go lighter on the weights as you will end up doing a huge number of reps.

All in all this is still a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness but on the hell week scale it is a 2 (‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è) out of 5 (five skulls being the worst). Last week‚Äôs hell week would have been a 4 out of 5 on the hell week scale.

  ##Monday 18 October 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
I really liked the class this morning. No inclines. No funky moves on the floor (no plank bird dog to half pike here!). Just straight running on the treadmill, using your own pace as a guide.

The tread block today is a run/walk in the 3G and a run/row in the 2G. You have 5 distance goals and then a run for distance. My advice is the maybe start at just under your push and increase your speed as the distances get shorter. Also only take the rest you need so if you don‚Äôt need the full 45 seconds just go a bit earlier. I like to keep the rest to may 20 seconds and then go again. Only a few people made the run for distance so it is sneaky hard. I made maybe 600m on top of the normal distances at a pace around about 10 mph. 

The row is a bit easier. Again 5 rounds with some medicine ball restercise in between.

The floor is all timed today. I would not go too heavy on the weights as you will be doing heaps of reps.

For today‚Äôs workout I give it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out 5 for gentleness.

  ##Sunday 17 October 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
This was a fun and deceptively hard template. Lots of moving around, short blocks and a good mix of power and endurance. 

The treadmill portion has 5 blocks in total but 2 are on the rower. Lots of timed stuff today. It features two 3 minute run for distances so try to pace yourself a bit as your legs will be jelly by the end. There is plenty of transition time to get to the rowers and back again so try and get back to base so your heart rate doesn‚Äôt drop too much.

I didn‚Äôt like the floor as much, a lot more on the core moves and not enough lifting. I didn‚Äôt particularly like the walkout combo (walkout pushup to high plank jack and then a pop squat) nor did I like the push up to bird dog. The double crunches are deceptively hard, particularly the hollow hold. For the floor blocks timed with the treadmill‚Äôs runs for distances these are called burnout challenges - the idea here is to do all the exercises with no rest. The others are tempo triplets and feature the same exercises but with different tempos / iso holds.

I saw a few people disagree with the feather rating yesterday but tbh I base it on how I felt compared to other workouts. Yesterday I thought was the easiest all week! This is a bit harder but maybe not for the intensity of the runs / rows but the efforts and movements felt a bit more difficult / tricky than the ones during the week. I give this template a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Saturday 16 October 2021 - Power 2G 60 minutes  
This was a bit of a relief today after the hellish start to the week. Almost a pure power session and only a little bit of rowing in the 2G. 

The treads all follow the same pattern. Alternating 30 second pushes and bases and a 30 second all out to finish. My suggestion is to go faster than your normal push pace as you will find that you will not get your heart rate up fast enough. If you are feeling up to it also add a bit to your all outs. I tried increasing my incline at every all out and thought that was a good way to test out the post-lockdown legs.

The floor features a low bench full burpee and plenty of 150m rows in the first block. I definitely was getting splats on the floor, especially if you are going hard on the rower. For those who want a bit of a challenge, the quickest time on the 150m row was 21.1 seconds. 

The last block is on the rower and is timed with the treads. You will do a ton of neutral full thrusters so pick a weight that will not cripple you over 2 minutes.

All in all this was easier than the last 5 days. I did get plenty of splats but it does depend on how hard you push yourself, you could easily do a Green Day on this template. I think the burpees and all out rows / thrusters at the end tip it over from a 4 to a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

Oh the coach also mentioned next Tuesday (19 October) is another hell week throw back!

  ##Friday 15 October 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
For those who wanted the 2G template instead - well here it is! Surprise surprise lots of people dropping out on Friday after yesterday‚Äôs hell week throw back. Today was marginally easier but not a hell of a lot. Mrs DC is doing the 3G so will see what that is like a bit later. 

On the treadmill it is all base pace at incline with one minute base in between. Three blocks and all of them are capped off with a one minute all out at the same incline as the rest of the block (!!!). With all outs at incline I would just put the speed up to get an all out feeling and not try to do your all out flat road pace (unless you can hold crazy inclines).

The floor features back to back supersets. First round is all shoulders, next is hamstrings / legs and the final is your back / lats. Try and pick weights that will challenge you but not cripple. I picked a good weight for my deadlifts but could barely do the reverse lunges in a single round. If my had my time again I would take the slightly lighter weight so I could get through all 16 reps (Edit: 16 total because you do 8 reps of the first exercise and then you go straight into 8 reps of the next).

There is no rowing in the 2G unless you are warming up on it - take that as a small mercy!

Today was a little bit easier. It may have even be a 3 if we didn‚Äôt have the all outs at the end of the tread blocks. Today is a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 14 October 2021 - Endurance (Hell Week Throw Back) 3G 60 minutes  
For those of you who skipped yesterday‚Äôs torture for today‚Äôs hell week session you have made a wise life choice. Today is brutal. 4.5 minute run for distance, never ending single arm snatches, distance challenges galore.

You will get splats everywhere on this template - there is nowhere really to rest. My suggestion on the treadmill is to pace yourself a little, I couldn‚Äôt do a full all out pace in the middle block as there wasn‚Äôt enough time to really rest between the run for distances. Furthest distance in our class for the last tread block was 1.4km (0.875 miles).

On the weight floor, because the snatch is the only weighted exercise I wouldn‚Äôt go too heavy for them as you are doing a huge number of reps and instead focus on form. Too light though will mean you whip through the exercises.

I rate this a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Mrs DC (/u/mrsdc031114) just came back from the class and said that this workout deserves no feathers!

**Tread Block 1**
* 2 min run for distance (record your distance)

**Tread Block 2**
* 90 sec run for distance
* 30 sec WR
* 1 min AO
* 30 sec WR
* 90 sec run for distance
* Aim to double your distance from block 1

**Tread Block 3**
* 4.5 min run for distance - aim to beat your distance from block 2

**Row Block 1**
* 2 min row for distance (record your distance)

**Row Block 2 - 4 minutes**
* Row your distance from block 1 + 10 x squats
* Repeat, dropping 200m off your distance goal
* If you cannot drop anymore then row for distance

**Row Block 3**
* 4.5 min row for distance, try to double your distance from block 1

**Floor Block - 13.5 minutes**
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 10 x pop jacks
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 15 x froggers
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 20 x speed skaters
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 25 x squat jacks
* 50 x bench hop overs
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 25 x squat jacks
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 20 x speed skaters
* 5 each x single arm snatch + 15 x froggers

Another pretty easy template today. Everything is base and inclines with four small all outs to break it up. I would recommend just getting back to base for the walking recoveries otherwise you may not get your splats. No splats on the floor as it is all strength exercises with a few ab dolly workouts.

  ##Monday 4 January 2020 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
I thought it was a bit rude today to have another endurance session after yesterdays epic run. At least they gave us a walking recovery in between blocks. Coach timed us on the 500m row, fastest in our session was 1:24.3 if you want to track that. Pretty solid floor block, only 2 rows (of 500m) but plenty of bosu work. They also said the 90 second run at the end of tread block 1 was an all out but reckon this was just a run for distance.

**Tread Block 1**

* 3 min push
* 1 min base
* 2.5 min push
* 1 min base
* 2 min push
* 1 min base
* 90 sec AO (run for distance)

* 1 min base
* 90 sec push

* 12 x bosu hip bridge
* 8 total x bosu palm to elbows
* 12 x bosu reverse hyperextension
* Complete two rounds and then do a 500m row (record time)
* Repeat floor exercises til time

**Floor Block 2 - 9.5 minutes**

* 12 x front loaded squat to arnold press
* 12 x hammer curl
* Complete two rounds and then do a 500m row (try to match or beat your time from the previous round)
* Repeat floor exercises til time",1609740038

  ##Sunday 3 January 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
I questioned whether or not this was an ESP given the tread block - definitely felt more like an endurance workout. Long pushes, shorter bases and you will end up doing a fair amount on the rower as well. If you want to get a bit of strength work in here then up the weights on the front loaded lunges and the goblet sumo squats. Coach told us to try and hold base if possible and drop the pushes if you need to. This is definitely harder on the treads than yesterday.

  ##Saturday 2 January 2021 - Power 2G 60 minutes  
Happy new year - first workout back and its a power day. For the 2G we have a run row challenge and a heap of short 30 second all outs. Floor is pretty much all TRX using explosive tempo to keep your heart rate up. If you are maxing out the speed on the all outs, try adding some inclines as you have heaps of recovery time. Most number of rounds in our studio (for tread blocks 1 and 3) was 5.

**Tread Block 1 - 5 minutes**

* 160m (0.1 mile) run

  ##Thursday 31 December 2020 - ESP 2G (NYE special) 60 minutes  
Final OTF workout for the year and its a good one. No base or push on the treadmill, just all outs at different inclines. The floor is also rapid pace with some endurance rows thrown into the mix. If you find you are getting into blue/green too easily on the treadmill (there are long 75 sec walking recoveries between all outs) then try to get back to base at least 30 seconds before the next all out. Quite enjoyed this one, not as hard as yesterday's run row but still quite fun.

If you get to the end of the floor block and you still have plenty of time on the clock I reckon just redo one of the rows to mix it up a bit.

  ##Wednesday 30 December 2020 - Endurance 2G (Run Row) 60 minutes  
I strongly recommend finding a studio that is going to do this as a 2G. I love run rows and endurance run rows are the best! Long runs on the treadmill with pulsing half squats and longish rows. Floor has the opportunity to go heavier as well with the goblet squats. We tracked the distance in the run for distance and the furthest in our class was 1.8 km (1.125 miles).

**Tread / Row Block - 23 minutes**

* 800m run
* 50 pulsing half squats

  ##Tuesday 29 December 2020 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
I was secretly hoping for a power day today after yesterday's strength workout. Today's template is very doable but still heaps of splats even on the floor with the neutral full thrusters, power pullups and  burpees. The bonus exercises are not too bad, basically hold them until fatigued and then swap to the other. If you can hold the plank for a long time then maybe just do 15-30 seconds on each and swap them around a bit more.

  ##Monday 28 December 2020 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
No push pace today, all just base pace and inclines with three 30 second all outs. The base recoveries and all outs are at flat road. For the last all out our coach asked if we can do an all out speed and not drop the incline.

The floor is all power rows to start with and then moving on to drop sets for your chest, triceps and back exercises. The rows are supposed to be coached with a set strokes per minute but we just did all out rows and tracked our times. We were coached to go as heavy as you can on the first four reps of the drop set and then pause to do the lighter weight. You can go pretty heavy as you only have to do 4 reps for the heavy weight.

  ##Wednesday 24 February 2021 - Orange Inferno 3G 60 minutes  
Today is the orange inferno. The main star is the rowing so get prepared to row for ages! The tread block only features 30 second efforts so you should find it very doable. I quite liked the floor as well with heaps of back and arm exercises.

For those who are competitive the furthest on the rower was 3600m! Though I think that perhaps they may have not done as many jump lunges as everyone else. Next furthest was around the 3000m mark and most people made over 2000m. If you don't want to do jump lunges then swap it out for reverse lunges or body weight squats.

I did see some of the 2G card for the run/row. Essentially it is rounds of 160m (0.1 mile) sprints with 100m rows. Each round you add another 100m to the row and you keep track of your total distance. Run stays the same each round. I think I would have preferred to do the 2G instead of the 3G (I love run/rows).

  ##Saturday 17 April 2021 - ESP 2G 60 minutes  
Tough little ESP session today. Loads of inclines on offer but also plenty of walking recovery in the last block. The floor also features our favorite - the ab dolly! 

On the tread we start with a bit of a strength block, all pushes on incline with base and a final 30 second all out on incline. The second block is all endurance and the third is power with incline all outs. I found I needed to get back to base on the last block as the 90 second walking recoveries were way too long. If you are following along for marathon month then I got 3.3 miles on the treadmill today (excluding warmup).

On the floor you do have quite a bit of ab dolly work but there are some short rows in there as well (until you get to the last block). Fastest time on the round of 150m rows was 22 seconds. The furthest anyone got in the last row for distance was 250m.

For todays template I rate it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. The inclines are high but the walking recoveries is pretty tame. Definitely a day to jog those long walks.

* 45 sec push @ 3-5%
* 45 sec base

* 2 min push

  ##Friday 16 April 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice power template today - very doable. You only have 30 second all outs but mixed in with one minute pushes and bases. The floor is all pretty standard as well. No really weird, complex moves. The row is also surprisingly easy.

Tread starts with a push/base combo leading to an all out. The second block is a series of push/base/all out. All pretty standard. I had to not do much of the walking recoveries in order to get a reasonable distance of 2.2 miles.

The row was tough if you treat it like an all out. Furthest in the 30 second AO row was 220m and 520m for the 90 second row.

The floor has one of my favorite exercises - the snatch! You may get some splats on the floor if you race through the exercises.

All up I thought this was pretty easy today - 4 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Thursday 15 April 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Felt almost like a rest day today compared to yesterdays epic crew row. Pretty much just base and incline on the treadmills and a couple of short pushes to all outs (at incline though!). The row was tough but manageable and the floor had a few combo moves.

I would just focus on the base pace today, the highest incline is 6% for a couple of minutes and that should be enough to get you well into the orange/red zone. For those interested, I did just over 2 miles on the treadmill excluding warmup so not great for marathon month.

The row is a little sneaky if you want to get some good distances on the row for distance. Furthest in class was just over 500m.

Floor has mini bands but I didn‚Äôt think it was too hard.. no monster walks, no lateral walks etc.

For today‚Äôs workout i rate it a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Nice strength block, tough but not unmanageable.

  ##Wednesday 14 April 2021 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
On the pluses today it is a endurance session so your marathon miles will be up and there are no burpees. But that is about it. You have 14 minutes straight on the treadmill and the rower. Floor has heaps of bosu work.

The treadmill is mostly push and base with a nasty 75 second run for distance at the end. The row is 14 minutes straight and the coach will ask you to do an all out for the last 75 seconds as well. 

Furthest distance in our class on the row was 4094. They were fresh though so I would wonder what they would get if they had been running for 14 minutes straight before that. 

The floor is relatively easy and you won‚Äôt get any splats.

For today, I give this template a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. I rarely get over 900 calories in class outside the ultra dri-tri and 90 minute / 2 hour sessions and this was one of them. If you are interested, I ended up (outside of warmup) with 2.3 miles on the treadmill.

  ##Friday 9 April 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
If your chest and biceps are not burning by the end of this then you have done the floor block wrong. The focus of today is endurance and power so you have some endurance blocks on the treadmill paired with a few all outs. Not too bad for marathon month. 

For the tread I just went back to base after the all outs in block 2 to keep the heart rate. Similarly on the rower you can just do 1 minute all outs if you want. No easy way out of the floor except to do lighter weights and maybe rest at the top of the reps.

I didn‚Äôt think today was too hard except for the exercises on the floor. I wouldn‚Äôt go too heavy as you will be dying by the end of all the curls and chest exercises. I rate today‚Äôs workout a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

Hello! Run/row in the 2G today, really challenging us with marathon month. I only got just over half my usual 2G distance, and that was with really upping my paces. I'm not the one who does the feather ratings, but it definitely felt very tough by the time I got to the burpees!

  ##Thursday 8 April 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Not the easiest of power templates but it is still a bit of a relief from the last couple of days. In keeping with marathon month there are still plenty of distance gains in the first and third blocks. The rowing is pretty tough with all the lateral hops and high knees. You may also get some splats on the floor with the power moves.

As with any power days, if you are not getting splats on the treadmill, either up your base pace or  get back to base on the all outs. I tried just holding my push pace for the tread blocks 1 and 3 and only dipping down a little for the base (alternating between 16 kmh to 15 kmh).

I rate today‚Äôs template a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness - mainly for the row block.

  ##Wednesday 7 April 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes - Walking celebration day  
Nice template today, pretty tough but felt a bit easier than yesterday‚Äôs endurehell. The walking celebration part is two 45 second walks at 14 and 15% inclines leading straight to 45 second all outs on the flat road.

Tread block is pretty brutal as is the rowing. 90 second pushes on inclines and 300m rows on repeat.

The floor block is not too bad. I don‚Äôt like the bird dog bench rows so I just substituted with a normal single arm low row. The concentration curl is a single arm bicep curl where you sit on the bench and rest your elbow against your inner thigh. Curl up with the arm and try to get a full extension / lock on the way down.

Today‚Äôs template I rate as a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5, mainly for the 90 second pushes on incline and the long rows.

**Tread Block 1**
* 90 sec push
* 1 min base
* 90 sec push @ 3%
* 1 min base
* 45 sec walk @ 14%
* 45 sec AO @ 1%

* 1 min base
* 75 sec push @ 3%
* 1 min base
* 45 sec walk @ 15%
* 45 sec AO @ 1%

**Row Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**
* Reset monitor
* 300m row + 8 each side x reverse lunge with rotation
* Repeat until time, record total distance

**Row Block 2 - 6 minutes**
* Reset monitor
* 300m row + 16 x alternating jump lunges
* Repeat until time, try to beat block 1 time

**Floor Block 1 - 6.5 minutes**
* 8 each side x bench single arm high row
* 8 x overhead tricep extension
* 16 x bicycle press

**Floor Block 2 - 6 minutes**

  ##Tuesday April 6th - 2G/3G Endurance.  
Same workout today for both templates. 

All blocks are one continuous 14.5min block!

Tread and Row follow the same structure:

- 3min Push
- 90s Base
- 2.5min Push
- 75s Base
- 2min Push
- 1min Base
- 1min Push
- 45s Base
- 1min AO

Floor is split into two sections, but treated as one continuous block. 

- 6x alt lateral lunge
- 6x alt reverse lunge
- 6x front squat
- 6x deadlift

Complete 1 round

- 6x hammer curl
- 6x neutral shoulder press
- 6x hip hinge high row
- 6x plank row to push up

Complete 1 round

Not quite sure why it‚Äôs split but I treated the first round with heavier weights than the second. 

Definitely the most challenging is the 14.5min row - goal is to get over 3000m. 

Have fun!",1617685216

  ##Monday 5 April 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Pretty tough template today. We have a run/rest on the tread and a very challenging row block. No splats on the floor as it is all core/stability with the bosu.

The treadmill is reasonable and you can go at your own pace. The rower I found a little harder as there is very little rest between row blocks (30 seconds) and if you are trying to beat your distance each round then you will be pretty much going all out for the first distance challenge, getting your jump squats done and then going all out for the row for distance.

For the treads, I would do an all out for the first couple of distances and then move to a push pace for the remainder. You don‚Äôt need to walk the entire time allotted either. I would get back to close to green and then start the next distance goal. Furthest distance in our class for the run for distance was over 1.4km for the run for distance (though he didn‚Äôt take any of the walking recoveries in getting to the 2.4km mark). I managed just shy of 600m taking some of the walking recoveries.

On the row block, it is a push to all out row for the distance goals and then get the squat jacks done as quick as possible to get back on the rower for the row for distance. Furthest distance in our class on the last row block was a 450m row for the row for distance.

Today was pretty tough, I rate it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness for the tread and row blocks.

Edit: even though we only really had enough for a 2G, we did a 3G instead (I reckon mainly because of the row block). For marathon month it would have been nicer to do a longer tread block but I wasn‚Äôt complaining.

  ##Saturday 3 April 2021 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Another tough workout today, particularly on the treads. Very little rowing which will cheer up a few folks. The floor features the ab dolly but overall it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Your arms will feel like jelly after the main floor blocks (mainly on the bicep curls and tricep kickbacks) but it is straight forward enough to get through.

Recommendations on the tread - most of the incline work is at base pace with a decent incline. For the all outs I would just go for your all out feeling which may be a bit off your normal all out pace. The last block has all outs and walking recovery at incline. You could probably increase your all out pace in this block given your starting from a walk.

On the floor, the L raise is where you have one arm that is doing a front raise and the other is doing a lateral raise. Do four each side and then swap the arm positions.

For today‚Äôs template I give it a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness, mostly for the tread work plus the ab dolly block.

**Tread Block 1**
* 3 min base @ 4%
* 90 sec base @ 1%
* 2 min base @ 5%
* 30 sec AO @ 6%

**Tread Block 2**
* 2 min base @ 5%
* 90 sec base @ 1%
* 1 min base @ 6%
* 30 sec AO @ 7%

**Tread Block 3**
* 1 min base @ 6%
* 90 sec base @ 1%
* 30 sec base @ 7%
* 30 sec AO @ 8%

**Tread Block 4**
* 30 sec AO @ 8%
* 45 sec WR @ 8%
* 30 sec AO @ 7%
* 45 sec WR @ 7%
* 30 sec AO @ 6%

**Floor Block 1 - 7 minutes**
* 8 x ab dolly pike to knee tuck
* 8 x ab dolly rollout
* 8 x ab dolly hamstring curl

**Floor Block 2 - 10 minutes**
* 300m row (once only) - 20 - 24 strokes per minute
* 8 x bicep curl to uppercut

  ##Wednesday 31 March 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Pretty standard power block today. The all outs are only 30 seconds long with very short push paces as well. The row is probably the hardest bit of the whole template with all the squat jacks. Floor was reasonably easy as well. Again, if you need to make it harder then just get back to base earlier and do 1 minute all outs instead of the 30 sec push to 30 sec all out.

Furthest distance on the row was 550m. We were also told to do all out rows for the first 30 seconds as well but I think that it is really just push rows.

Just because of the rowing I rate this a 3 (ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

  ##Tuesday 30 March 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes  
Looked like I missed a good one yesterday! Definitely a 1 (ü™∂) for gentleness. Today is a little kinder but not much more. Heaps of splats on offer, especially on the tread and rower. 

Good news is that the max incline is only 4%. Bad news is that all the inclines are at push pace and you start with a 3 minute push (at incline) to 30 second all out in the very first block. The next block features 90 second pushes at incline and finishes with a one minute all out.

Row block is pretty tough. We only had 4 people finish and get to the row for distance at the end.

The floor block I thought was great. Warming up with the mini bands and then straight into some classic upper body exercises.

I thought today was pretty tough. I rate this a 2 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness..

  ##Wednesday 7 August - 2G - Follow The Leader - Run / Row üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö£üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
Let me start by saying I cannot remember the exercises in order, or what I actually did to be honest. Know that it is upper body focused with a variety of burpee in each block. Here is what I can remember;

**Floor**

*Block 1*

- 10 x chest fly ü¶ü

- 5 x burpee rollout 

- 10 x  spatulas (scaption)

- 10 x ?

*Block 2*

- 10 x bicep curl üí™üèª

- 10 x pop jack üéà üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- 10 x lateral raises

- 5 x burpee

*Block 3*

- 10 x thrusters üöÄ

- 10 x plank low row things üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüö£üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- 20 x bench hop overs üêá

- 10 x burpee

**Run/Row**

- 700m row

- 160m AO @ 1%

- 600m row 

- 160m AO @ 2%

- 500m row 

- 160m AO @ 3%

- ....etc

**HOW IT WORKS**

- Groups of 3 

- All start on the rower

- If Partner A finishes first they go to the tread at sit at base (with the same incline for that round). Partner A then waits for the other two to finish

- Once all your group has finished you all start the run together.

- If Partner B finished the run first they go to the rower and row at a base pace

- Once the whole group has finished the run you then start the 600m together

- So on and so forth

**Notes**

- This was a 2G, not sure how it would work as a 3G

- It‚Äôs not as complicated as I‚Äôve made out

- Everyone is our class was really good at motivating each other

- Still not sure about those exercises

- Personally I took this day as a ‚Äúbase day‚Äù, concentrated on the exercises and then being part of the team rather than gunning it

- We tried to finish the run/rows as a team so there was very little rowing/running at base",1565154825

  ##Wednesday July 31 OTF Workout  
Good morning from sunny Australia! Here is today's 3G layout - sorry if there are errors on the order of the floor exercises...It was a lot to remember today.

Today's **power** workout was a killer.

It was kind of a tornado format, with 3.5 minutes at each station.

**Tread Block 1 - 3.5 minutes**

30 second push

30 second base

30 second all out

1 minute walking recovery

30 second push

30 second all out

**Row Block 1 - 3.5 minutes**

300 m row

12 Froggers

200 m row

12 Froggers

100 m row

12 Froggers

Row for distance if you finish

**Floor Block 1 - 3.5 minutes**

10 x (5 each leg) Weighted step-ups onto the bench

10 (or 12?) x Rotating squat jumps (the ones where you rotate 90 degrees when you jump up)

Keep repeating this, dropping the reps of the squat jumps by 2 each time. If you finish, hold a plank.

**Tread Block 2 - 3.5 minutes**

Exactly the same as tread block 1

**Row Block 2 - 3.5 minutes**

Exactly the same as row block 1, except now it is 10 froggers instead of 12

**Floor Block 2 - 3.5 minutes**

10 x (5 x each arm) Hollow hold chest press (thanks u/orangegirl26 for the right name :) )

10 x Pop jacks

Keep repeating this, dropping the reps of the pop jacks by 2 each time. If you finish, hold a plank.

**Tread block 3 - 3.5 minutes**

Exactly the same as tread blocks 1 and 2

**Row Block 3 - 3.5 minutes**

Exactly the same as row blocks 1 and 2, except now it is now 8 froggers

**Floor Block 3 - 3.5 minutes**

10 x Reverse mountain climbers (basically you hold a crab walk position and bring your knee up to your chest)

10 x Power sit-up with rotation

&amp;#x200B;

PHEW...I hope that is all right. Sorry if there are errors!! The OTF brain is real today. HAVE FUN! I normally don't like this many switches, but today was actually great - you need the downtime between stations.",1564549943

  ##3G - 15 January 2020  
# POWER

* u/matthotlips has posted the 2G, which I've used to do this post. Thanks Matt! 
* Is it a switch? Nah[.](https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Power) 

**Floor**

*Block 1*

5 minutes:

* pull ups
* plank spiderman to leg raise
* hollow hold close grip chest presses

*Block 2*

Until time called, I think it was about 7.5 minutes:

* split stance high rows
* plank arm extensions
* snatches

**Treads**

*Block 1*

* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec AO

**Rowers**

* 150m row
* 10 squat jacks
* repeat 
* three blocks of this, you essentially match the tread blocks so there are more efforts on block 1 as it's longer. I think there may have been a row for distance variation if you finish on block 3 but I forget... u/jemesct any edits? 

Enjoy! üê®",1579068062

* 45sec Push row
* 30 sec Base row

Tread Block 2: 8mins

* Run at your own pace, but aim to make or go past the same distance as Block 1

**Floor**

Block 1: 8 mins

* 6 x Swing lunge L leg (where you do a lunge stepping back, and then the same leg stepping forward)
* 6 x ISO lunge hummer curl

Sorry, I definitely don‚Äôt have all the names (and some of the descriptions may be a bit ropey). Legs are feeling like jelly after this one!",1579932061

  ##Sunday 15 March 2020 - 2G Power  
Welcome to Sunday - no enforced spacing yet in Australia but big focus on wiping stations down and reducing contact (e.g. no high fives) with other members and staff.
Having said that, today is a nice power session. Good chance to get your splats especially on the last floor block if you want to really push it. Plenty of walking recovery (approx about a minute for each) with only one nasty little push to AO in the second tread block. All blocks were 10.5 minutes in length.

**Tread Block 1**
* 1 min push
* 1 min base
* 45 sec AO
* WR
* 1 min push
* 90 sec base
* 45 sec AO
* WR
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 45 sec AO
* WR

**Tread Block 2**
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec AO
* WR
* 45 sec push
* 45 sec base
* 45 sec AO
* WR
* 45 sec push
* 90 sec base
* 45 sec AO
* 45 sec WR
* 45 sec AO

**Floor Block 1**
* Hinge hip dumb bell flys x 8
* Bicycle press dumb bell x 12
* Repeat once only
* 150m row
* Scaption x 8
* 24 x running man
* Repeat once only
* 150m row
* If finished do all the floor exercises as a single block

**Floor Block 2**

  ##Saturday Endurance 3G - Ellen Workout  
Hey OT Fam

Today‚Äôs workout was so GOOD! Loved it üíï 

Lots of pushes to bases and why not throw in some 1000 metre rows just for fun! 

Should point out that between block 1 and 2 of the treadmills you probably only get 5 seconds to catch your breath before you have the 500 metre run for distance üòä

Our coach said in the 2G it was a 1600 metre or 1 mile run for distance ü§î

Treadmill - 8.5 mins

1 minute push

1 minute base

1 minute push

1 minute base

75 second push

1 minute base

75 second push

1 minute base


RESET TREADMILL (and count to 5... because that‚Äôs how much rest you get üòÇ)

Treadmill Block 2 - 5.5 mins 

500 metre all out

30 second recovery

160 metre all out 

30 second recovery until time is called


Rowers - 14 mins 

1000 metre row

12 alternate reverse lunges

200 metre row

12 lunges

X 3

1000 metre row

12 lunges

200 metre row

12 lunges

Repeat the 200 metre row and lunges until time is called 

Floor Block 1 - 9 mins

6 x TRX Single leg squat

12 overhead press with rotation

12 x bird dog

12 x bosu single leg v up 

Floor Block 2

10 x weighted lateral lunge 

10 x bosu front raise


That‚Äôs all guys! Such a tough workout but I love myself a challenge especially at 6am in the morning! Sorry if I got any of the floor wrong.... honestly I wasnt really paying any attention to what the names of the exercises were! 

Hope everyone has a fab day and have a merry Christmas! üéÑ",1576908062

  ##Tuesday Endurance  
Morning OT Fam! 

Today is a fantastic day, especially if you are competitive with yourself (like me üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

This is a switch! You kind of need it 

2 x 10.5 minute treadmill blocks

2 x 3 minute rows

2 identical floor blocks 

Treadmill (progressive push) 10.5 mins 

3 minute progressive push (starting at .5 to .8 above base and increasing .5 to .8 every minute)

1 minute base

2 minute progressive push (starting at your highest push from the 3 minutes. Again increasing .5 to .8 each minute)

1 minute base

90 second push (starting at your highest push from the 2 minutes. Again increasing .5 to .8 after 45 seconds)

1 minute base

1 minute all out 

*Switch*

I got 2.633 kms or 1.636 miles for everyone playing at home ü•∞ 

Floor block 1

3 minute row

10 bench step ups with weight each leg

10 lateral bench toe taps

10 seated shoulder press to stand

10 bench sit ups (with weight)

*Switch*

Tread Block 2 (10.5 mins)

Pretty sure this is where all of my red zone points came from üòÇ 

3 minute push

1 minute base

2 minute push

1 minute base

90 second push

1 minute base 

1 minute all out


* Switch*

Done!

Hope everyone has a fab day ü•∞ 

Oh and in the second tread block I got 2.667 kms üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or 1.657 miles",1576562456

  ##Sunday 3G ESP  
This workout had a bit of everything!

It‚Äôs actually power not ESP ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòä thanks for pointing that one out 

üéà workout was a switch between rowers and treadmills

üéàvery short blocks so our coached politely asked us to up our push and all out üòá

üéàdecreasing rowing efforts with medball power jacks 

üéà3 x 4 minute switches from treadmill to rower in each rowing and treadmill block

14 minute floor block

10 x power bench push-up 

20 x lateral bench step overs

X 5

(Decrease power pushups by 2 each round)

10 x tricep kickbacks

20 x speed skater

X5

( Decrease tricep kickback by 2 each round)

10 x lateral raise

10 x pop jack üë¥ 

X5

(Decrease lateral raise by 2 each round)

Treadmill (4 minutes)

30 second push

30 second base

30 second push

30 second base

30 second all out

30 second walk

30 second push

30 second all out

*Switch*

Rowing (4 minutes)

300 metre row

10 medball power jacks


200 metre row

10 medball power jacks


100 metre row

10 medball power jacks


Row for distance if you finish :)

*Switch*

So to make sense of this I started on the treadmill so I went treadmill, rower, treadmill then I switched to the rower and did rower, treadmill, rower then finished on the floor for 14 minutes 

If you started on the rower you would have went rower, treadmill, rower, FLOOR BLOCK, then treadmill, rower, treadmill

Hope this makes sense and have a fab day :) 

Going to go and do my Chrissy shopping as I haven‚Äôt started üòÖ but have to get that orangetheory session in as always

Have a fab day everyone ü•∞",1576389656

  ##Friday the 13th - Endurance - 3G - Sydney  
Oh you know how this is going to go! Felt like a nice, not *too* challenging workout but I got 9 splat points on the floor (no idea!!) and 36 in total, compared to my average 20th. So I'd say this is a good one. Betty-o-meter: 8, that running stretch is intense.

**TREADS** \- 13.5 minutes

30s Push

30s Base

x 13 times

30s AO (just the one, after the last 30s base)

**ROWER**

130m row

13 squat jacks

130m row

11 squat jacks

130m row

keep decreasing number of squats by 2. When down to 1 squat start all over again.

**FLOOR**

OK so we have 6 exercises. We start with the first 2 x 2 reps. Then add the next exercise, 3 reps for all 3. And so on.

1. Front squat
2. TRX Roll-up
3. TRX tricep extension
4. Push-up
5. Plank jacks
6. Burpee

1 - 2 x 2 reps

1 - 3 x 3 reps

1 - 4 x 4 reps

1 - 5 x 5 reps

1 - 6 x 6 reps

1 - 7 x 7 reps

If you finish the whole block, continue with 7 reps of each.

Hope this makes sense!",1576216861

  ##Friday 10/11/19 2G Early Intel (ORANGE EVEREST!!!)  
Morning! Hope everyone is prepared for Orange Everest. It's a doozy. Hopefully below isn't too confusing for people who haven't done it before...

&amp;#x200B;

Tread Block 1 - 23 Minutes

First minute at 2% incline

Increase 1% every minute until 15% incline (the top of Everest! üèîüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

First decrease is 1%, then decrease by 2% every following minute until back to flat road

1 min AO

&amp;#x200B;

Floor Block 1 - 14 minutes

Close grip chest press

Seated hammer bicep curl

Bicycle (x12)

250m Row

Repeat until time is called (including the row). Reps for first two start at 12 and decrease by 2 each round.

&amp;#x200B;

Floor Block 2 - 8 minutes

Bench plank low row

Seated overhead tricep extension

Straight leg raise (x12)

Repeat until time is called. Reps for first two start at 6 and increase by 2 each round.

&amp;#x200B;

Have fun!

Edited to add: I feel like I should put it out there that this workout isn‚Äôt as scary as it seems. Everyone in my class (there was a whopping 11 of us) ended up power walking towards the top and then picked up speed again on the way down.

Also: this is technically a run for distance! Your distance will be tracked and the goal is to beat the distance your old, less-fit self got last time. üòâ",1570770063

Hi friends, workout intel here from an American taking a holiday in New Zealand and Australia. Sorry I don‚Äôt have the same humor as our Australian friends...but anyways...

Yes, it is a switch.

Yes, there are worse ways to start Hell Week (AKA last years burpee blitz on the first day)

Do I know anything about the 3G? So glad you asked, why yes I do. It‚Äôs pulsing half squat hell with switches for days (honestly seems like more hell for the coaches to keep the 3G workout straight)

  ##PULSE Hell Week Day 1 - 3G death hour  
The 3G workout is a doozy, so bear with me here. Basically, everyone's workout will be different depending on where you start class so choose wisely.

PHS = pulsing half squats

&amp;#x200B;

Tread Block, 14 minutes (assuming you start on the treads):

* 90 sec run for distance
* 1 min WR
* 75 sec run for distance
* 1 min WR
* 1 min AO
* 45 sec WR
* 45 sec AO
* 45 sec WR
* 30 sec AO
* 45 sec WR
* 45 sec AO
* 45 sec WR
* 1 min AO
* 1 min WR
* 75 sec run for distance

&amp;#x200B;

While the treads are going, the floor and the rower are switching back and forth. They are doing work during the times when the treads are running and transitioning while the treads and in their walking recovery. If you started on the rower your first 14 minutes will look as follows:

* 90 sec row for distance
* 75 sec PHS
* 1 min AO row
* 45 sec PHS
* 30 sec AO row
* 45 sec PHS
* 1 min AO row
* 75 sec PHS

If you started on the floor your first 14 minutes will look as follows:

* 90 PHS
* 75 sec row for distance
* 1 min PHS
* 45 sec AO row
* 30 sec PHS
* 45 sec AO row
* 1 min PHS
* 75 sec row for distance

&amp;#x200B;

Following the first 14 minutes of class,everyone returns to where they started class.

&amp;#x200B;

If you started class on the treads, your second 14 minutes looks as follows:

* 90 sec run for distance
* 75 sec PHS
* 1 min AO run
* 45 sec PHS
* 30 sec AO run
* 45 sec PHS
* 1 min AO run
* 75 sec PHS

&amp;#x200B;

If you started class on the rower, your second 14 minutes looks as follows:

* 90 sec row for distance
* 1 min rowcovery
* 75 sec row for distance
* 1 min rowcovery
* 1 min AO row
* 45 sec rowcovery
* 45 sec AO row
* 45 sec rowcovery
* 30 sec AO row
* 45 sec rowcovery
* 45 sec AO row
* 45 sec rowcovery
* 1 min AO row
* 1 min rowcovery
* 75 sec row for distance

&amp;#x200B;

If you started class on the floor, your second 14 minutes looks as follows:

* 90 sec PHS
* 75 sec run for distance
* 1 min PHS
* 45 sec run for distance
* 30 sec PHS
* 45 sec run for distance
* 1 min PHS/75 sec run for distance

&amp;#x200B;

Following the second 14 minutes of class, everyone returns to where they started class.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you started class on the treads, your last 14 minutes looks as follows:

* 90 sec run for distance
* 75 sec row for distance
* 1 min AO run
* 45 sec AO row
* 30 sec AO run
* 45 sec AO row
* 1 min AO run
* 75 sec row for distance

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you started class on the rower, your last 14 minutes look as follows:

* 90 sec row for distance
* 75 sec run for distance
* 1 min AO row
* 45 sec AO run
* 30 sec AO row
* 45 sec AO run
* 1 min AO row
* 75 sec run for distance

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you started class on the floor, your last 14 minutes look as follows:

* 90 sec PHS
* 1min burpees
* 75 sec PHS
* 1 min burpees
* 1 min PHS
* 45 sec burpees
* 45 sec PHS
* 45 sec burpees
* 30 sec PHS
* 45 sec burpees
* 45 sec PHS
* 45 sec burpees
* 1 min PHS
* 1 min burpees
* 75 sec PHS

&amp;#x200B;

ENJOY. I made the mistake of starting on the floor so I AM DEAD.",1571893271

  ##Wednesday 19 August 2020 - Endurance 3G 60 minutes  
Pretty good endurance template with very little rest on the treadmill or rower. Given this is the dri-tri row prep I would start on the rower. Floor block was tough if you are doing it after the run and the row so you may want to drop your weights on the dead lifts and squats. After all that the transition to the plank felt like a rest!

  ##Thursday 13 August 2020 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Personally I found the tread block on this template reasonably hard (all the 2 minute pushes on inclines) especially after the big endurance blocks the last couple of days. It did feel more like an endurance template with some hills thrown in.

  ##Tuesday 11 August 2020 - Endurance 2G 60 minutes  
This is the dri-tri prep so strap in for a long, 23 minute treadmill block! Furthest in our class was 5.6km (3.5 miles). My strategy was to start slightly below my 12 minute run speed and keep increasing it in the subsequent pushes. I was in the red for pretty much the entire tread block though...

The floor is all single leg movements - if you don‚Äôt like the sit to stand you can do pistol squats with the TRX.

**Tread Block - 23 minutes**
* 5 min push
* 1 min base
* 4 min push
* 1 min base
* 3 min push
* 1 min base
* 2 min push
* 1 min base
* 4 min progressive push (start just above base and add 0.5 - 1.0 km/h per minute)
* 1 min AO

**Floor Block - 23 minutes**
* 2/4/6/8 x static lunge (each leg)
* Complete four rounds and do a 250m row (record time)
* 2/4/6/8 x bench sit to stand (each leg)
* Complete four rounds and do a 250m row (try to beat previous time)
* 2/4/6/8 x TRX single leg dead lift (each leg)
* Complete four rounds and do a 250m row (try to beat previous time)
* 2/4/6/8 x lateral bench step up (each leg)
* Complete four rounds and do a 250m row (try to beat previous time)
* 2/4/6/8 x single leg hip bridge
* Complete four rounds and do a 250m row (try to beat previous time)
* If finished then do all exercises in a single block at 8 reps",1597122069

  ##Sunday 9 August 2020 - Strength 2G 60 minutes  
Pretty easy template today (to make up for yesterday?!?) with long walks and transitions between floor and rower. Our coach said we should try and do an all out for the flat road run for distance. For the floor we had 90 seconds to transition to the rower (whilst treadmills are doing walking recovery) - I think to make this a bit harder you could get back to a base row sooner or do some sort of power move in between. 

The deadbug was a new move for me. Essentially lie on the floor with your arms up and legs up and bent at the knees so your lower legs are parallel to the floor. Then lower one arm and the opposite leg to the floor, return and repeat with the other arm/leg.

**Tread Block 3**
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base
* 30 sec push
* 1 min base

  ##Thursday 27 May 2021 - Mayhem 5 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Burn Rubber‚Äù 2G 60 minutes  
Early class today so I got to catch the 2G of this template and it is a doozy. As the title suggests it is all about the mini bands on the floor so if you can‚Äôt feel your shoulders or glutes after this you‚Äôve done something wrong. 

On the treads it is not a run/row. They have invented the run / frogger. Not sure which one is worse. This starts with a mile run up inclines. Then you finish with froggers + 160m (0.1 mile) sprints down the same inclines. Then you run for distance. The template didn‚Äôt call for froggers after the last sprint but our coach made us do it just for fun. If interested, the furthest anyone got in the run for distance was 1.9km (1.19 miles). My tactic was to start the mile run at push pace and start to decrease it from 5% onwards. When you get to the froggers, pause the treadmill so you can keep it at the right incline and then start it up as soon as you get back on. That way you don‚Äôt lose any time waiting on for the treadmill to get back to your incline. Maybe take a few moments to walk as it gets back up to speed so you can get your breath back. I couldn‚Äôt do the last rounds at an all out given there is no recovery but you should be able to do a high base to push pace. Once it gets back down to 2-4% you should be able to do all outs again.

The floor is also one long block featuring all the mini band exercises you love / loathe. You start with an 800m row (just in case you missed the rower from the run/frogger). You then have ab dolly knee tucks to start then front raises, lateral walks, static crunches, squats. Barely anyone finished the floor block. No tactics here, you just have to try and push through.

I reckon this is the second hardest mayhem template. The run is not as bad as Sunday‚Äôs but is a very close second. I give this a 1(ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness.

**Tread Block - 22.5 minutes**
* 1.6km (1 mile) run starting at 1% and adding 1% incline every 160m (0.1 miles) finishing at 10%
* 10 rounds of:
* 10 x froggers
* 160m (0.1 mile) run @ 10%
* Each round decrease the incline by 1%
* Reset treadmill and run for distance @ 1%

**Floor Block - 22.5 minutes**
* 800m row (once only)
* 40 x ab dolly knee tuck (once only)
* 5 rounds of 8 x low band neutral front raise + 8 total x low band plank in and out
* 5 rounds of 4 x mid band iso squat lateral walk + 8 total x mid band squat to alt leg lift
* 5 rounds of 8 x mid band static crunch in and out + 8 x mid band toe reach
* 40 x ab dolly knee tuck (once only)
* If finished (good luck) just do all mini band exercises as a single block",1622091636

Thanks to Mrs DC we have the 3G intel. Sorry to say that it is still a 1 (ü™∂) for the template. Tread mill looks a lot easier than the 2G but the rower looks pretty brutal - loads of froggers!

**Tread Block 1 - 14 minutes**
* 1.28km (0.8 mile) run @ 1% - every 160m (0.1 mile) add 1% incline (power walkers 0.64km @ 5%)
* 1 min WR
* When done:
* 160m run (0.1 mile) @ 8% (power walkers 80m @ 12% or greater)
* 30 sec WR
* Decrease incline by 2% each round
* Complete four rounds
* If done then run for distance until time is called

**Row Block**
* 30 sec iso squat hold
* 45 sec to do 20 x froggers
* 1 min AO row
* 30 sec recovery
* 30 sec AO row
* 45 sec to do 20 x froggers
* 30 sec recovery
* Repeat 3 times

**Floor Block - 14 minutes**
* 40 x ab dolly knee tuck (once only)
* 4 rounds of 8 x low band neutral front raise + 8 x low band plank in and out
* 4 rounds of 4 x mid band iso squat lateral walk + 8 x mid band squat to alt leg lift
* 4 rounds of 8 x mid band static crunch in and out + 8 x mid band toe reach

  ##Wednesday 19th August, 2G 60min Endurance  
Edit: it's Thursday today. Too early!!


Although it was quite fun watching the panic yesterday without early intel, I'll be kind and post it today.... Pretty classic endurance template especially designed for people who don't like walking recoveries, because there are none!

  ##Tuesday 31st August, 2G 60min Endurance partner workout

Tread block 2, 13 mins

- 2.5 min push
- 1 min base
- 90s push
- 1 min base
- 30s push
- 1 min base
- 90s push
- 1 min base
- 2.5 min push
- 30s all out

Tread block 3, 3.5 mins

- 3.5 min run for distance

Floor block 1, 18min

- Partner A: 12 hip hinge high rows
- Partner B: TRX high row until partner A finishes

*Partners switch exercises, complete 3 rounds each*


- Partner A: 12 Goblet squats
- Partner B: TRX alt. reverse lunge until partner A finishes

*Partners switch exercises, complete 3 rounds each*

*Partners switch exercises until time*",1630386035

  ##13 October 2021 - ESP 3G 60 minutes  
Ok - now I am pretty sure I would have found today‚Äôs class tough even before my 106 day forced hiatus from OTF. Today‚Äôs class is really just a mix of strength and endurance and I had a huge number of splats on the treadmill and rower.

The treadmill starts with a 2 minute push and then goes into push with incline combos. Then it ends on a 1 minute all out. THERE IS NO WALKING RECOVERY! I am pretty sure my heart rate was in the red for almost the entire block. Bonus points if you add a little extra to the all out at the end. I was pretty stuffed at the end but did manage a 2 mile block in the 3G which is rare.

The rower is all distance rows with medicine ball exercises to test out your hamstrings. Probably only a quarter of the class got to the bonus round.

The floor is probably the only place that you can hide from splats but if you want to do it properly, load up the weights on the drop set and see if you can barely push out the 4 reps at the start. My arms were shaking at the end of it. For the person who was complaining about all the leg work recently, here is your chance to not feel your chest and arms for the rest of the week.

Oh and we have the hell week throwback tomorrow.. am sure that will be fun. For today‚Äôs session I give it a 1 (ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. It may have been a 2 pre-lockdown but 30 splats (14 in red) tells me this was particularly tough.

  ##12 October 2021 - Power 3G 60 minutes  
Nice template today. If you are on the treadmill you only have 30 second all outs but there is a progressive push in the mix. The rowing is also pretty good with the first round a distance challenge and the last block is timed with the treads. The floor has some power moves combined with timed exercises as well.

For the treadmill, we were coached to start at a pace slightly above base and to continually increase it until you get up to your push pace. If you are like me and just getting back into it I took the incremental lifts a little bit lower than normal and then just did normal pushes for the second block.

I thought today was pretty good, maybe a little bit tougher than yesterday but that is mainly because of the push to all out efforts. 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness today.

* 30 sec AO row
* 1 min recovery row
* 1 min push row
* 30 sec AO row

**Floor Block 1 - 6 minutes**

  ##Monday 11 October 2021 - Strength 3G 60 minutes - ‚ÄúStrong and Stable‚Äù  
Hooray! We finally have had our restrictions lifted in New South Wales and it means all the gyms are open again! Over 100 days since we were in the studio and it is a doozy to start back with. Think endurance session but with hills. No push pace just all base at varying inclines and a short all out at the end. I started a little under my pre-lockdown base pace but then threw caution to the wind, ignored the heart rate monitor and just did my normal hill base and all out.

The rower is all about the power strokes mixed with a set of balancing exercises with the medicine ball. Given I haven‚Äôt used a rower for a long time I probably thought this was the hardest in the whole template. I think they had also just refilled the water rowers so we got loads of resistance out of each stroke.

The floor is all strength moves followed by a stabilizing exercise with the TRX straps and then a core exercise. To get the most out of this I would do everything quite slowly and try to up your weights for the first exercises.

I quite liked the workout (possibly because it is the first one in such a long time) but had plenty of splats (25!) so I reckon it was pretty tough. I give this a 2 (ü™∂ ü™∂) out of 5 for gentleness. Extra foam rolling today and maybe something for the calves.

#2G ORANGE VOYAGE / ARC

**Please read**

If you hate rowing, please don‚Äôt cancel because of this intel. This was a super achievable workout. Enjoy it!!!

**Rowers**

This is a 22.5 continuous row block, excluding the warm up. 

Similar to a traditional tread block these were timed intervals starting with a 3 minute push effort and a base recovery effort. The interval times then varied. Let me have a think about the interval times or I‚Äôll edit with feedback. 

_EDIT - APPROX INTERVAL TIMES_

Thanks to u/cr84 for the below. 

The ‚Äúon‚Äù efforts below were like a push effort. ‚ÄúOff‚Äù efforts were a base row - it doesn‚Äôt mean stop rowing. 

* 3 min for distance (‚Äúon‚Äù) 
* 1 min recovery (‚Äúoff‚Äù) 
* 90 sec on 
* 90 sec off 
* 60 sec on 
* 60 sec off 
* 30 sec on 
* 30 sec off
* 3 min on 
* 60 sec off 
* 30 sec on 
* 30 sec off 
* 60 sec on 
* 60 sec off 
* 60 sec on (?)
* 90 sec off
* 3 min on to finish

_NOTES_

* take a row card to start on the rower 
* row card holders warm up on the rower, and stay on the rower for their block 
* do not rack your handles at all during the row block

Goal was 5km. As you completed each benchmark after 3km, you got a little card indicating your distance. 5km = orange card üß°

**Treads and Floor**

20.5 minutes of work. If you complete, do the exercises only. This is a run-floor workout. 

_ONE_

* 0.2 mile run push pace
* 20 chest press on the TRX
* 20 mountain climber things where you put knee to opposite elbow 

_TWO_

* 0.15 mile run push pace or greater
* 15 low row TRX
* 15 hip hinge swings with weight 
* 15 tricep extensions with weight 
* repeat all of the above

_THREE_

* 0.1 mile run all out
* 10 plank hip dips each side 
* 10 power sit up 
* repeat all of the above
* aaaaand... repeat again

In the final minute of the floor block, move towards the rower and do a squat hold in front of the rowers on the corresponding station number, to give them a little encouragement in the final minute. I loved this!

**NOTES**

* this is not a switch

  ##Friday 2G ESP  
So I know why no one has attempted to write this class up because my head is still spinning from all of the switches and changes that happened in this class

I will give this a go BUT be warned... it‚Äôs probably going to be wrong ü§™ 

A little insight into what happens today

Yes it is a switch, yes you get lots of recovery, but hey that‚Äôs great that means that you can row that little bit harder on your all outs or maybe go that little bit faster on the treadmill. Take it as a positive not a negative. And if you struggle to get splats because there is that little bit more recovery do what I did.. get to the treadmill that little bit faster and get to base so you get in the orange zone that little bit faster üß°

üôÉ it‚Äôs a switch not a tornado

ü§® 3 x 3 minute blocks on the treadmill

ü§ì 3 x 3 minute blocks on the rower

ü•≥ Every Block is 3 mins

  ##Saturday 2G Strength  
I thought someone else would‚Äôve posted by now and wasn‚Äôt concentrating - so apologies for memory lapses!

Rowing / Floor:

Each block started with one round of the rowing activity, then move to floor. All blocks were around 7 mins.

15 stroke - work on form (so you were meant to go REALLY slowly, around 16-18 strokes / min) and see how far you got in 15 strokes 

Floor blocks: all 3 rounds, 6/8/10 reps

Round 1: bicep curls, triceps extensions

Round 2: dumbbell uppercuts, extensions (lying in bench, arms extended, lowering dumbbell over head)

Round 3: chest fly, hip hinge upright row 

Tread blocks:
 
This is where I‚Äôve forgotten a fair amount - sorry! 3 blocks again.

I know it was along the lines of 3 min incline push, 90 sec base, 90 sec incline push, 1 min base, 30 sec all out...

And in the last block there was no gap between the 1 min push and 30 sec all out at the end.

Hopefully someone else can fill in the blanks!",1568437690

#POWER

This is not a switch. I don‚Äôt know the 2G modifications. Legs legs legs. 

**Treads**

* 13 x 30 second AO followed by WR
* the first six WRs were 30 seconds and the balance were 45 seconds: more rest to challenge you to up your AO

**Rowers**

* 130m followed by 13 med ball squat to overhead reach 
* repeat row and med ball reaches but do one less med ball reach each round
* rowing distance does not change

**Floor**

There were 6 exercises, 13 reps each. At random times during the workout, 13 burpees flashed onto the screen (this happened 3 times in the 3G). 

The exercises were:

* ground to press, weighted 
* calf raise, weighted 
* Y raise on the TRX
* pike crunch
* ab dolly knee tucks (I think)
* ab dolly hamstring curl (I think)
* the randomly placed burpees described above

Enjoy! üê®üß°",1568351381

Short form intel as I‚Äôm late for work... again LOL.

* not a switch
* get ready to shave those legs 
* idkthe2g {edit: now posted by u/allysonevans1 with thanks!}

**ROWERS**

Grab a set of weights. 

Two blocks. Don‚Äôt reset the monitor in block one. 

Block one:

* 150m row
* 14 shoulder press
* repeat above 150m row + shoulder press combination, but do one less shoulder press each time until time called 

Block two:

* 4 minute row: try to beat your distance 

**FLOOR**

This was six mini band exercises... for 14 minutes. Exercises were in pairs, so repeat the first two twice, second two twice, final two twice, and then if you finish, run through all exercises as a single block. The usual suspects:

* monster walks with mini band 
* tap bench with butt with mini band 
* lateral walks with mini band
* squat with leg kick backs (side to side) with mini band 
* planks with mini band on forearms/wrists 
* scissor leg raises with mini band on forearms/wrists

**TREADS**

Two blocks. 

Block one:

* 30 second push
* 60 second base
* 60 second push 
* 60 second base
* 90 second push
* 60 second base
* 2 minute push
* 30 second AO
* WR

Block two:

* 30 second push
* 60 second base
* 2 minute push
* 30 second AO
