**2G STRENGTH SWITCH**

Hi team🍊!

Resuming normal service. Few gremlins posting yesterday... so thanks u/matthotlips for posting and u/lookie4dacookie for getting me back online ☺️

I also posted the 3G in a separate thread via another member ☺️

**Treads 1**

Courtesy u/c01788

Treads 1 - I did this about 8 hours ago now but I think I've remembered correctly!

30 second base at 7%

1min normal base

30sec base 7%

30sec base 5%

1min normal base

30sec base 7%

30sec base 5%

30sec base 3%

1min normal base

30sec base 7%

30sec base 5%

30sec base 3%

30sec all out 1%

I believe PW %s were 8, 6 and 4, then 10 or higher for the all out

[Disregard my notes from earlier, which I’m keep in for posterity... Round 1 was a series of hills going up and down the hill - 7, 5 and 3% mixed with base and push and varying interval lengths, the longest being 90 seconds. I’m sorry I don’t remember it in detail, you’ll understand why I’ve forgotten when you read round 2... Only so much a person can remember! I can update if anyone can help me out! 🧡]

Move to floor. 

**Floor 1**

* 10 upright row, weighted
* 10 Leg raises
* 5 each side low row single arm on bench
* 10 ? raise on the floor but I forget exactly what sorry! 

Repeat twice and then complete one 250m row 

**Treads 2**

This is a run/floor combo. Grab a set of weights for bicep curls. 

160m below is 0.1 miles. This is the jogger and runner combination. 

* 160m 7% push
* 10 bicep curls
* 160m 7% base
* 160m 5% push
* 10 bicep curls
* 160m 7% base
* 160m 5% base
* 160m 3% push 
* 160m flat road base
* 10 bicep curls
* 160m 7% base
* 160m 5% base
* 160m 3% push 

I may have misremembered but I’ve done my best!

**Floor 2**

45 seconds on 15 seconds off, repeat 3 times:

* band around wrists, low rows
* band as above, scissor legs
* mid band around calves, toe reaches 
* band as above, in &amp;amp; outs
